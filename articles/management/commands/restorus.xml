		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There is a particular myth that has haunted the liberal psyche for generations.  Because it has haunted the liberal psyche, it has also haunted the American psyche for Americans have thus far postponed the decision first postponed by the founders and have, since the founding, tolerated the liberal tradition.  This is the myth of there being a dichotomy between tyranny and anarchy.  Liberalism teaches that there are two political poles, authority and anarchy.  You exchange less authority for more anarchy, less anarchy for more authority, and partisans tend to either favor a strong state or a strong people.

This is part of a larger project to demonstrate how most "authoritarian" systems were in fact anarchist systems.  This attacks the so-called "liberty" of the libertarians first.  This is necessary since libertarians are more well known for their distinction between "statism" and the "love of liberty."

Friedrich Hayek is a role model for what masquerades as the right today, so he is the first in my sights.  Thomas Sowell, Rush Limbaugh, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Milton Friedman all admired Hayek and agreed with him.  Recently, Glenn Beck has begun suggesting Hayek's works as recommended tea party reading.  Dr. Hayek is recommended reading for libertarians, a label that he proudly wore instead of the descriptor "conservative" [1].  But Dr. Hayek is not recommended reading for a thinker of the right, save for the sake of knowing your enemy.  This author contends the following about Dr. Hayek:

1. Dr. Hayek was a progressive.  What I mean by this is, Dr. Hayek believed that history was a story of the gradual improvement in morals, technology, and the overall human condition.

2. Dr. Hayek was a materialist.  I mean specifically that Dr. Hayek believed that the human condition is determined by our material existence and condition as opposed to a spiritual orientation.

3. Dr. Hayek was an advocate of the abolishment of sovereignty and its replacement by a world state.  Naturally this "world state" is hardly a state at all, but a clearing house for international commerce, however it does possess the ability to make war.

Let's start at the beginning.  Dr. Hayek's progressivism.  Most people imagine progressives to be people on the left.  Mr. Beck will tell you that they are the Clintons, the Obamas, the Roosevelts and he's right, but they're also the Hayeks, the Palins, and the Reagans.  So in a sense, most people are right: progressives are people on the left.  However, that's another post for another time.  For now, we aim at Dr. Hayek.

Dr. Hayek fought the progressives of his time, to be sure, however he did so only because he didn't consider them progressive enough.  This view is expressed beautifully in the last sentence of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> where he says, "The guiding principle that a policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy remains as true today as it was in the nineteenth century." [2]  Hayek draws from the 19th century classical liberals, as he makes clear in more places than worth citing.  He claims in chapter two that socialism has a false claim to be descended from the liberalism of the 19th century.  What passes for liberalism today is not, the argument goes, the liberalism of yesterday.

The progressivism of our current time seems to be of a moral kind; human beings are going to become more moral as time goes on (through the acquisition of civil rights and economic equality).  We will become smarter and kinder, so they say.  Dr. Hayek echoes the belief in moral progress when he writes, "The rules of which our common moral code consists have progressively become fewer and more general in character." [3]  He goes on to describe "primitive man" who was apparently little more than an ape in a loincloth who had to adhere to a restrictive set of rules lest he eat bugs out of his fellow man's hair.  Perhaps I exaggerate a little, but the sentiment is there.  The aim of the collectivist is to reverse this and institute a set of restrictive measures to limit our movement.  This ties well with the sentiment expressed in the first sentence of chapter 2 where he says "socialism has displaced liberalism as the doctrine held by the great majority of progressives." [4]  Socialism, which according to Hayek, began as a fight against the ideals of the French Revolution, has absorbed progressives from the old liberal parties into the new socialist parties and convinced them that socialism was progress.  (Addressing this idea is a post in itself.)  But nowhere does Dr. Hayek question the belief in progress itself, which leaves open a very large hole in his philosophy: what do we do when we achieve capitalistic freedom?  Progress doesn't stop.  As he writes in another work, <i>The Constitution of Liberty</i>, "civilization is progress and progress is civilization" and we should bear in mind that "Progress is movement for movement's sake."

Second, Dr. Hayek's materialism.  Contrary to the sentiment that some kind of moral base is at the heart of society, Dr. Hayek insists that economics is the core of civilization.  He, like most free-market economists, defends himself of the charge that he's "econo-centric."  He writes, "The ultimate ends of the activities of reasonable beings are never economic. Strictly speaking, there is no 'economic motive' but only economic factors conditioning our striving for other ends." [5]  His argument is not that individuals are greedy miserly creatures who care only about money, but his argument is that people are strictly conditioned by their economic circumstances.  In discussing government, Dr. Hayek writes that "Democracy is essentially a means, a utilitarian device for safeguarding internal peace and individual freedom.  As such it is by no means infallible or certain.  Nor must we forget that there has often been more cultural and spiritual freedom under an autocratic rule than under some democracies." [6]  Then he exhorts us to support democracy (not republican government; this can be inferred because Hayek's academic environment in native Austria was anything but loose when it came to terminology) because of the dangers of planning.  But we're faced with a curiosity; Hayek advocates democracy because it guarantees "individual freedom" but he admits that "cultural and spiritual freedom" are often higher in non-democratic governments.  The spiritual is implicitly sacrificed for the material.  This is because the economic is equivalent to the spiritual for Dr. Hayek.  Writing about WWII he says, "The war between England and Germany is therefore really a conflict between two opposite principles. The 'Economic World War' is the third great epoch of spiritual struggle in modern history." [7]  The first was the French Revolution and the second was WWI.  International economic conflict will be discussed more in the third point, but what can be seen here is Dr. Hayek's view that economics is the determining, moving factor in human history.  All of these conflicts mark progressive milestones on the path to more freedom.  And he certainly does not condemn the first milestone; Professor Hayek is a firm supporter of the ideals of 1789. [8]  Which, it should go without saying, are ideals birthed in the "commercial spirit" as opposed to a different spirit.  It is worth mentioning that Dr. Hayek seems strangely in agreement with Karl Marx, who argued that human history is directed by material conditions.

Third, Dr. Hayek's support of a world state.  Dr. Hayek's philosophy is incompatible with the existence of sovereign political entities.  A United Nations or a League of Nations, or at the very least, a mutually assured international order is needed to ensure free trade.  He writes, "we cannot hope for order or lasting peace after this war if states, large or small, regain unfettered sovereignty in the economic sphere." [9]  A new power is needed that can ensure the free transfer of goods and services.  This condition must be forcibly imposed if necessary because "It is neither necessary nor desirable that national boundaries should mark sharp differences in standards of living, that membership of a national group should entitle to a share in a cake altogether different from that in which members of other groups share." [10]  Dr. Hayek views the world through a solely economic paradigm.  One should then not be surprised if his vision of international government centers around economic enforcement.  We cannot be satisfied with his humanitarianism for very few people are purposely evil.

Tyranny stems from anarchy, so let us examine the anarchist elements in Dr. Hayek's philosophy.

First, his progressivism is inherently anarchist.  This is true because his conception of the state is like that of most other libertarians: a structure of coercion set up to govern people's bad elements.  Progress, as has been shown, assumes that these bad elements will be done away with as we progress.  If these bad elements no longer exist, then the state is no longer a "necessary evil" and can be done away with.  Left wing philosophy, when followed to its conclusion, is always anarchical.  The socialists all called for an abolition of the state, and so too do many libertarian circles.  It will be argued that not all libertarian circles are progressive.  This is false; they are.  Theirs is a material progress which shares the same dark pedigree as moral progress.  When followed to his logical conclusion, Dr. Hayek's arguments lead straight to the abolition of government.

Second, his materialism is anarchic.  By sacrificing the spiritual to the material, he adopts a theological materialism.  God is a topic not to be discussed since only the material can be known, analyzed, and proven.  Even the material is subject to doubt at times because of human inability to know the truth, but that very admission - that we cannot know the truth - can easily lead weaker individuals to either doubt its existence or act as though it didn't exist.  This lack of truth annuls every social bond.  If I cannot know about God, I cannot know about the spiritual.  If I cannot know about that, I can barely know about the material.  If the material is the only thing I see, I cannot know if it's what I should see.  That lack of "should" is anarchy in the true sense of the word, it is an anarchy of the soul.

Third, his internationalism is anarchic.  This is perhaps a very controversial point, but his world state is no state at all.  It is a functional abolishment of politics altogether.  Given his due, Dr. Hayek's world state would (if it could) abolish other sovereign states' ability to defend themselves or have boundaries - in effect making them non-states.  His world exists after a war to end war and a war to end politics.  We all become members of one "state" which cannot be considered a state since political groupings depend on the identification of non-members.  "Membership" means belonging; belonging requires that some things belong while others don't.  A world state is tantamount to a non-state.

So Dr. Hayek's arguments lead to anarchy.  But where's the tyranny?  We can use the classical definition of tyranny, that is to say that tyranny is being subjected to the self-interest of the ruler.  Let us combine his materialistic outlook with his world state.  What do we have?  A democracy, obviously, for this is the only framework suited to protecting economic freedom.  And what does he say about it?  It is a utilitarian means of government.  Because the only frame of reference these international democrats have is that of the material, what is "good" will be what is beneficial to material interests and what is "bad" will be harmful to these interests.  What we are left with, inevitably, is a system that serves the self interest of the majority, who happen to be the rulers.  In a word, tyranny.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp;GOMORRAH: Carl Schmitt presents a consistent critique of liberalism. Authors on the right such as Leo Strauss and Hermann Rauschning have contended that Schmitt was neither right wing nor consistent, but this author feels he was both. For one, Rauschning's sensibilities were likely to be offended by Schmitt's emphasis on the universal conflict; he was likely to see there the seed of fascism that was responsible for Schmitt's membership in the party. He likely saw a man who joined the party, then proceeded to praise the struggle of the age. There was no need to dig any further. Strauss, on the other hand, saw past Schmitt's alleged fascism and deserves credit for ironing out some of Schmitt's issues, but still fundamentally misunderstood his position.

Though Schmitt left us a few works, we will look first to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226738922?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0226738922">The Concept of the Political</a>. This work is rather infamous in academic circles for being the book that promoted one of Schmitt's core ideas: politics is about friends vs. enemies. It is infamous rather than famous because academics are offended by such a suggestion. With it vanishes all opportunities for world peace, international cooperation, and any kind of world that does not exist in a state of perpetual fear of war.

<b>Chapter One</b>

We begin in chapter one of the 1932 edition. This review foregos the use of the 1927 edition since we will discuss the changes between the two when we review Heinrich Meier's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226518884?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0226518884">Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: The Hidden Dialogue</a> at a later date. No doubt, however, that the reading of that and other works has colored this review. The first sentence of the book, "The concept of the state presupposes the concept of the political." [1] is very important for our purposes. Under Schmitt's paradigm, the state exists only so long as the political is a (implicitly or explicitly) recognized concept. Likewise, concepts about the political influence the form that the state will take. Schmitt rejects the claim that the state is synonymous with politics whenever the state becomes involved with society. Whenever the possibility of a political dispute arises within the state, the state itself can no longer be considered the political unit. When this happens, the "neutral" domains of religion, economics, science, and culture (by neutral he means the non-political) become active in a political struggle. They carry with them the friend/enemy distinction and with it the possibility of violent conflict. "[t]he total state which no longer knows anything absolutely nonpolitical, the state which must do away with the depoliticalizations of the nineteenth century and which in particular puts an end to the principle that the apolitical economy is independent of the state and that the state is apart from the economy" is the state of a post-Enlightenment world. [2] Citing a work on Hegel, Schmitt points to the possibility that the non-interventionist state of the 19th century inevitably becomes a totalizing state of absolute control.

<b>Chapter Two</b>

Because of these confusions and developments, which shift the domain of the political to one sphere then back onto everything human society comes into contact with, we find ourselves in need of a stable definition. Thus, Schmitt writes, "The specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced is that between friend and enemy." [3] The political enemy doesn't have to be a grotesque monster or a moral opposite (though as we shall see, Schmitt's enemy is both), it just has to be something that sufficiently threatens a group's way of life.

<b>Chapter Three</b>

He argues that the grouping of friends and enemies will always exist, and does exist in our liberal world. Schmitt then seemingly sidetracks to a discussion about personal and public enemies as the Bible treats them. He writes that most modern languages don't have words that distinguish between the two but that Greek and Latin did. Thus the passages "Love your enemies" in Matthew 5.44 and Luke 6.27 apply only to the personal, private enemy but that the political opponent does not have to be loved. [4] One may accuse Schmitt of praising militarism. He does not. As he writes later, the military battle itself is not important. [5] What counts is the possibility of conflict. A world without that possibility is a world without politics, which contains nothing of real value or interest, simply entertainment. There is of course the effect that trying to stop war would have. Schmitt writes: "Nothing can escape this logical conclusion of the political. If pacifist hostility toward war were so strong as to drive pacifists into a war against nonpacifists, in a war against war, that would prove that pacifism truly possesses political energy because it is sufficiently strong to group men according to friend and enemy. [...] The war is then considered to constitute the absolute last war of humanity. Such a war is necessarily unusually intense and inhuman because, by transcending the limits of the political framework, it simultaneously degrades the enemy into moral and other categories and is forced to make of him a monster that must not only be defeated but also utterly destroyed." [6] With Schmitt, there is a distinction between the enemy who must simply be defeated and the foe who must be annihilated.

<b>Chapter Four</b>

In chapter four, Schmitt continues to demonstrate that the division between friends and enemies is inescapable. Schmitt uses the formula to diagnose the true political nature of situations and in doing so he reveals more of his true colors. Writing about Bismarck's assault on Socialism and Catholicism and how this assault failed because the two forces held more sway over people's minds, Schmitt states that the Reich was "not absolutely sovereign and powerful." [7] Other forces held the title of sovereignty and the political. In his explanation, he reveals his theological base by saying, "[t]he juridic formulas of the omnipotence of the state are, in fact, only superficial secularizations of theological formulas of the omnipotence of God. Pluralism, for Schmitt, is a negation of this omnipotence. When left to reach its logical conclusion, pluralism transforms the state into a realm on the same level as groups, associations, and "nonpolitical" spheres. This at once is the work of a negation of politics, but because politics cannot be negated it is a universalization of the political. Every group begins to possess the potential to group people according to friends and enemies.

<b>Chapter Five</b>

In this chapter, Schmitt argues that the genuine political sphere possesses the right to declare war. Differing very little from the arguments of the prior chapters, Schmitt uses this chapter to emphasize how the political is fundamentally different than other spheres. This contradicts his statement in chapter one [8] that friend vs. enemy in politics equates to moral vs. immoral in ethics and beautiful vs. ugly in art. This contradiction is not an accident. Schmitt writes in defense of the political, for he equates the political with the theological. Politics is an issue of faith; all political statements are either orthodox or heretical. Schmitt's base is not rational. [9] It is something outside the scope of human comprehension and thought.

<b>Chapter Six</b>

Chapter six consists of Schmitt's destruction of the "world state" concept. He uses the inevitability of the friend/enemy distinction to target the liberal international order. A League of Nations or any political group claiming to represent humanity must, according to the logic of politics, dehuamnize and annihilate the enemy. "To confiscate the word humanity, to invoke and monopolize such a term probably has certain incalculable effects, such as denying the enemy the quality of behing human and declaring him to be an outlaw of humanity; and a war can thereby be driven to the most extreme inhumanity." [10] "Humanity" is not a political concept for Schmitt. When it becomes one, it distorts the real political groupings. The world state as it's conceived, which is to say a universal government that has successfully abolished war and conflict, cannot be anything more than a clearing house of commerce. It, as a result, strips us of all meaning. "For what would they be free?" [11] Schmitt asks of the inhabitants of this new world state.

<b>Chapter Seven</b>

Here we come to the heart of Schmitt's argument. In chapter seven, he asks us to test political theories by their anthropology. The question of human nature is the basis of politics. The consistent political theories are those that assume human nature is bad or at least potentially dangerous. [12] Radicalism, which is to say intellectual shifts away from orthodox beliefs, is the product of affirming that human nature is good. The more benevolent you believe humans to be, the more radical your politics. Schmitt roots these views in theology. He argues that theology is only real theology when the theologian considers human beings to be sinful by nature. [13] Schmitt elaborates by saying, "The fundamental theological dogma of the evilness of the world and man leads, just as does the distinction of friend and enemy, to a categorization of men and makes impossible the undifferentiated optimism of a universal conception of man. In a good world among good people, only peace, security, and harmony prevail. Priests and theologians are here just as superfluous as politicians and statesmen." [14] This "fundamental theological dogma" has the same effect as the friend/enemy distinction. One may posit that these two are related, though in order to identify Schmitt's enemy and its connection with this theological dogma we will need to review <i>Political Theology</i> at a later date. We may only content ourselves by noting that Schmitt ends chapter seven by resting politics on the truth in Genesis 3.15. To affirm the scripture is to affirm Schmitt's politics; to deny the friend/enemy distinction is to deny Genesis 3.15, which for Schmitt is a mere step away from denying the rest of the Word.

<b>Chapter Eight</b>

Chapter eight begins by briefly examining the nature of liberalism. Schmitt argues that it attaches itself to different traditions in order to gain power, arguing that Catholicism and even democracy are not liberal but in fact anti-liberal systems that liberalism just seeks to coalesce with. There is here no consistent liberal position. Liberalism, insofar as it is an individualism, will promote a constant distrust of authority. [15] Followed to its conclusion, there is always a negation of the state, of politics, of church, but no positive theory. Individualism is incapable of requiring a sacrifice for a higher ideal. All that is left is pure materialism and trade. What remains of the state is a small government dedicated to securing the conditions of this materialism. [16] The book wraps up with an exposition on how the progressive view of liberalism triumphing over feudalism and slavery has led to the creation of new political realities, so that the League of Nations (who, at the time, stood for peace and cooperation between countries) reserved the right to sever food supplies to civilian populations until target states liberalize. All of this is done by representing humanity while dehumanizing the opponent. There is, of course, no escape from the political.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: This follows <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/dr-hayeks-secret">two</a> <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/libertarianism-death-anarchy">articles</a> that attempt to demonstrate that Dr. Mises and Dr. Hayek were closet fascists. The fear of knee high leather boots might be the only reason the acclaimed <a href="http://mises.org/">Mises Institute</a> doesn't have a swastika on their coat of arms. Naturally this author is joking. Libertarians really do believe they're fighting fascism; in fact, their very sincerity is what's so frightening.

The careful reader of the previous articles will note that, at most, it was demonstrated that the liberal international order we see embodied in the United Nations and the uncompromising mindset of the progressive are all logical outgrowths of classical liberal thought (which is why we may agree with the libertarians of today when they say they're the heirs of that tradition). There was not, however, a clear demonstration that libertarian government leads to tyranny <i>as the modern reader understands it.</i> It leads to a tyranny of the soul, a tyranny of our own personal interests trumping every other concern, and a tyranny of a liberal international order seeking to evangelize by force. But these are all tyrannies the modern reader will either fail to notice, actually agree with, or attempt to stamp out with a liberal application of liberalism. That police state with the concentration camps and mass arrests that everyone likes to invoke whenever TSA gets grabby is still yet to be seen.

This article attempts to show you one vision of what happens when the anarchists take power. Now naturally a real anarchist will contest that last sentence - anarchists don't "take power", they're "against power." These are simply the words of an anarchist who is not yet in power. Revolutionary movements are all centered on power, even if that power is attained with the end goal of eliminating power. Unlike other writers on the so-called right, this author won't tell you that the revolutionaries secretly want to oppress you. They want to free you from oppression. Their very sincerity is what's so frightening. So we should briefly look at one of the most sincere, well-meaning groups of revolutionaries: those who ran Soviet Russia for over 70 years.

Very few people on the right will tell you that the Soviets weren't tyrannical. With all the gulags, mass murders, and secret police activity they are a perfect example of tyranny and fear. Despite what anti-crowd sentiments we have, we may agree with the crowd this one time: the Soviets were about as tyrannical as they come. But it is inaccurate call them "statists" or the outcome of "big government." But we may say that they are the logical outcome of Marxism practically applied, while agreeing with the political scientists who say that they betrayed the original Marxist position, but we would be going to far if we agreed with anyone who says that the Revolution looked nice on paper but just didn't work out as planned. (The last statement is particularly disgusting; it seems to invite a second attempt.) Instead of focusing on the size of their state, this author takes a different stance: there was no state in the Soviet Union.

The word "state" comes from the Latin <i>status</i> meaning "a manner of standing, position, condition." In Primitive Indo European it was a root meaning "to stand." When the word was used to describe government, it began to stand for a supreme political and civil authority. In English today, we use this word interchangably to describe government as well as generally unchanging conditions. Even when we say that something is in a state of disarray, it's typically assumed that it will stay that way until something or someone intervenes to change the situation into another state.

Revolutionaries have historically identified themselves as members of movements. They may be the relatively mild mannered rights/labor/gender movements we see today, or they could be socialist and anarchist movements. But they all <i>move</i> when they're in these movements. It makes sense; progress is thought of as a movement toward a better state of being, or more specifically an infinite movement toward infinite perfection. There's never any stop in the march of progress, it is a continuous process (and needs to be in order for the revolutionary movement to exist - should the leadership become satisfied, a more radical base will grow impatient and take over). Because progress is continuous, these "better states of being" aren't really lasting conditions, but stepping stones to more bliss. To really get to the point of what I'm saying, a <i>movement</i> is the very antithesis of <i>standing</i>. Every revolutionary cries "peace, peace" but there is no peace, since peace is rest and there can be no rest in an eternal movement. So in the sense of "a manner of standing, position, condition" we can say that revolutions cannot be pro-state.

Answering the claim that revolutions, particularly the one wrought by the Soviets, oppose "supreme political authority" is a little trickier. As Carl Schmitt wrote, "Although the Bolshevist government repressed the anarchists for political reasons, the complex to which the Bolshevist argument actually belongs contains an explicitly anarcho-syndicalist chain of thought." [1] In other words, though the Soviets stamped out other revolutionary movements, their identity rested on an anarchist base. For the ideas of Marx, Sorel, Proudhon, and Bakunin to hold the status of sacred texts in the Soviet intellectual system, this system had to fundamentally agree with the revolt against authority contained within these authors. Schmitt writes further, "For Proudhon and Bakunin, anarchism meant a battle against every sort of systematic unity [...] The concrete individual, the social reality of life, is violently forced into an all-embracing system." [2] When the individual is forced to confront all authority as evil, that individual has become completely anarchic; when that individual is constrained by the logical conclusions of anarchy (i.e. total destruction, total disunity) their intellectual system has grown to become totalizing, totalitarian.

However, we must refrain from calling this intellectual system an "authority." Nor can we, for long, say that it has "power" over people. Hannah Arendt wrote a piece that explored the differences between the words, power, authority, force, strength, and violence. She said that people use these words as synonyms since we associate them with individuals making other individuals do things, but this is inaccurate because there are different means of persuasion. [3] To summarize: power is when people act in concert to accomplish goals, authority is an unquestioning recognition of truth, force is "the energy released by physical or social movements", strength is a quality that relates to the character of a thing or person that's independent of them, and violence is the instrumental use of physical persuasion.

The Soviets began by dismantling the Czar's government and establishing syndicalist councils called soviets, which were gatherings of workers. These quickly degenerated and the country fell into a state of social atomization and totalitarianism.

How did this happen? The movement exists as a cohesive unit capable of acting. Internally, at least, the movement has power. It multiplied this power so that it can have the instruments of violence at its will, which it uses by force to get people to think that the intellectual system is an authority. However it is not and cannot be an authority since its basis rests on the ultimate, perpetual questioning of authority. Left to itself, the movement will always consume its own (Stalin always follows Lenin) as this questioning is carried out. With the disintegration of all authority, the violence itself assumes power. Under a system of perpetual surveillance and mass arrests, which were carried out by the movement, social atomization begins to isolate individuals from each other. Anyone can be an informant and so everyone is alone. There is no power, even in the secret police, since no one can act in concert. We are left with nothing but violence and the fear of it, we are left with totalitarianism. What have we learned? It isn't about the size of your state but the motion of the ocean.

				<title>Libertarianism: Death &amp; Anarchy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: This article is a follow up to <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/dr-hayeks-secret">this one about Dr. Friedrich Hayek</a> and are part of an effort to show that libertarianism leads to anarchy and death.  Dr. Ludwig von Mises is the next target. Dr. Mises is still extraordinarily popular in libertarian circles, but is little discussed in mainstream political circles.  The readers of this site, however, are not likely to be mainstream so Dr. Mises warrants investigating.

This article will take Dr. Mises in roughly the same order as Dr. Hayek.  However, Dr. Mises rejects progress more thoroughly than Dr. Hayek.  All of it implies, for him, a value judgment that cannot be made because his arguments stem from the teachings of economics.  His "Science never tells man how he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to attain definite ends." [1]  It is from this objective view as a disinterested scientist that Dr. Mises becomes the most interested party in the actions of his fellow human beings.  We cannot determine which morals ought to be preferred, so a judgment about progressive morals makes no sense.

There is, however, a material progress.  He writes that people like me "do not realize that the tremendous progress of technological methods of production and the resulting increase in wealth and welfare were feasible only through the pursuit of those liberal policies which were the practical application of the teachings of economics." [2]  In this one quotation we have the crux of Dr. Mises' argument.  In reading this sentence, you read the most important part of his writings, the only thing that summarizes his life's work.  When the teachings of economics are applied, it's called liberal policy.  When that liberal policy is realized, it results in material well being via technological development.  That is called progress.

This should be enough to demonstrate in the mind of the reader Dr. Mises' materialism.  He will of course say "We adopt neither the 'materialistic' view that such a progression is good nor the 'idealistic' view that it is bad or at least irrelevant from a 'higher point of view.' Of course, it is a well-known fact that the immense majority of people consider the consequences of progress [...] as the most desirable state of affairs [...]" [3]  Statements such as these are misleading; Dr. Mises is known as the "Knight of Liberalism", proclaims himself a liberal in many places, and wrote <em>Human Action</em> to explore practical economics in detail.  In this sense, one can respect Dr. Mises.  He has identified what he is and defends his views.  He stands for something.  His arguments that he speaks only from the perspective of neutral science is simply a smokescreen to cover the deep convictions of this writer.

Let us uncover these convictions.  Dr. Mises writes, "The program of liberalism, therefore, if condensed into a single word, would have to read: <em>property</em> [...] All the other demands of liberalism result from this fundamental demand." [4]  After this critical argument, the only things that are considered persuasive to Dr. Mises are arguments rooted in economic reason.  Slavery is condemned as bad for the economy.  Writes Dr. Mises, "When those who recommended the abolition of involuntary servitude on general humanitarian grounds were told that the retention of the system was also in the interest of the enslaved, they knew of nothing to say in rejoinder.  For against this objection in favor of slavery there is only <em>one</em> argument that can and did refute all others - namely, that free labor is incomparably more productive than slave labor." [5]  The moralists couldn't win; the <em>one</em> argument that could win (his emphasis) was economic.

A similar process is undertaken when examining the Spartan King Leonidas' sacrifice at Thermopylae: "Even Leonidas would not be worthy of the esteem in which we hold him if he had fallen, not as the defender of his homeland, but as the leader of an invading army intent on robbing a peaceful people of its freedom and possessions." [6]  For Dr. Mises, actions are admirable when they serve an economic motive and arguments are persuasive when they are rooted in economic reasoning.

Dr. Mises, like Dr. Hayek, holds strong views about foreign policy.  He writes, "The liberal therefore demands that the political organization of society be extended until it reaches its culmination in a world state that unites all nations on an equal basis.  For this reason he sees the law of each nation as subordinate to international law."  [7] More broadly, "His political thinking encompasses the whole of mankind." [8]  Dr. Mises holds no punches about how this thinking encompasses mankind.  He writes that "In order to bring the interests of Europe and of the white race into harmony with those of the colored races in the colonies in regard to all questions of economic policy, the League of Nations must be given supreme authority in the administration of all those overseas territories in which there is no system of parliamentary government." [9]  Granted I'm quoting one of Dr. Mises' earlier works, his 1927 <em>Liberalism</em>, and his views about the interests of the white races vs. the colored races may have changed in later works.  A summary of <em>Human Action</em>, which is considered Dr. Mises' authoritative work shows that he looks down on people who discriminate (because it hurts the economy of course) and he doesn't, to my knowledge, even cite <em>Liberalism </em>in the work despite including several other books like <em>Bureaucracy.</em>  Regardless, Dr. Mises and subsequently Ms. Greaves who writes the preface to my edition, feels content to allow the book to be printed.  We are forced to understand that this is the statement of a man with imperialistic tendencies.

His racial issues aside, Dr. Mises finds no fault with the contemporary colonization of foreign territories and would like to see a world state manage them until they've adopted parliamentary government.  It's little gems like these that cause me no little confusion over the strong following that Dr. Ron Paul was able to accrue during the last Republican presidential primary.  I partially understood the fascination with Dr. Paul who presented a thoughtful alternative to the traditional partisan fight.  Dr. Paul is well read and does his best to find a consistent argument, there's no doubt about that.  But when Dr. Paul had a following of people who opposed a world state and the kind of intervention that the United States has carried out in recent years, but then in the same breath tells his audience to read Dr. Mises, I can't help but laugh.  If the formation of a world state is the work of demonic entities (as has been attested by certain Christians), then a vote for Dr. Paul is a vote for Satan.

The story of tyranny is virtually the same as for Dr. Hayek.  Politics is stripped of morality, of seriousness, and of meaning.  The only public policy arguments permitted are about money.  People are permitted to be religious so long as their religion doesn't interfere with their money.  Self interest is supreme, because there are no groups, no sides, no identity outside the self.  This self, of course, is <em>a priori </em>to any other argument.  It is an assumption that is made to discuss human actions and is beyond discussion and debate.  It is a scientific assumption, something that is assumed to be concretely true.  It is, at its heart, an article of faith and from it is built the entire structure of the church of classical liberalism.

But how is this a tyranny?  How specifically can I argue that allowing people to do what they want is oppressive?  To allow people to be dictated only by their own whims is to make them slaves to those whims, to marginalize the spiritual existance of people in order to substitute it with material well-being is to enslave the spiritual to the material.  To state that "all antiliberal doctrines - the theocratic tenets of the various religions, statist, nationalist, and socialist parties - ... all promise their followers a life of plenty.  They have never ventured to tell people that the realization of their program will impair their material well-being." [10] is to profess a profound ignorance of the spiritual life of human beings.  They are written in an age of vanity and by a man who likely never encountered a genuinely spiritual system of thought.

It is a strange thing that the free market liberals often criticize the United Nations, international law, and "welfare state liberals" for being "statists" when free market liberals created these problems.

				<title>The Christchurch Quake Ought to Shake Christ&#039;s Church</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/religion/christchurch-quake-ought-shake-christs-church</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In modern life, it is atypical to credit the divine with any kind of direct intervention in our lives.  In particular, we term events as "natural disasters" because they just happen; we view them as random, ordinary events, though tragic in their destruction.

Yet the Book of Matthew states "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places." (24.7)

Our society hates the idea of a God that intervenes in nature.

In 1755, a massive earthquake practically destroyed the City of Lisbon.  The great minds of Europe had several heated debates over the nature of the quake.  Immanuel Kant published three essays on earthquakes, Voltaire and Rousseau had arguments over it, and people later said that the six year old poet Goethe was first brought to skepticism by Lisbon.  Lisbon, an Enlightenment stronghold, was blamed for the quake by some religious authorities.  Had the people not been as sinful, they wouldn't have been struck with such a quake.  The pro-Enlightenment thinkers, in what they claimed was a defense of God, said that God didn't intervene in nature.

This argument, which grew up in 1755, is the basis for the kind of reaction most thinkers have to people grafting a theological meaning on natural disasters.  God does not intervene in nature.  It is a statement full of implications for our political standing.  If God does not intervene in nature, then only human beings do.  This places the responsibility for all evil in human hands. However, if all that is bad is our fault, then we get credit for all that is good.  Particular interventions by the divine become an impossibility in a world of universal principles since, by their nature, particulars are exceptions.  Given enough particulars (or even just one) and the universal rule stops looking so universal.

In short, the idea of an interventionist God destroys the foundation of liberal thought.  Human progress goes out the window in a world where God tries to communicate to the faithful. Total states crumble before a transcendental authority that means enough to believers to sacrifice for.  When God starts allowing plagues of Biblical proportion, the story of humanity begins to look more Biblical - i.e. a story of corruption ending in apostasy.  The only solution, the only real progress comes only after Christ has punished the infidels.  The role of humans is pushed aside when the main actor is the Lord of Hosts.

Assuming a God that talks to the faithful assumes a God that's keeping score.  That scares some people.

If we were, just for the sake of argument, to assume that God communicates through the faithful through various signs and wonders and that earthquakes are one of the signs we're told would come, would it make sense to believe that something strange is afoot when two large earthquakes can strike the city of Christchurch in New Zealand in just six months?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Japan&#039;s Quake Reminds Us of Our Fragility</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Japan as they cope with such a massive disaster.

The earthquake in Japan is unique.  Not only was it so massive, but it resulted in somewhat minor damage.  Japanese building codes are designed to protect major cities from earthquakes, however something as big as an 8.9 is going to do some damage.  As of this writing, some of that damage is on-going; a nuclear reactor could melt down as a result of extensive damage.  There's already a small radiation leak.  Thankfully people have been evacuated, but a complete meltdown would render the area a mess for years - it could, foreseeably, become a Chernobyl type area.  Not only is Chernobyl a dead zone that's off-limits to people, but its vacancy makes it a destination for vagrants and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,412954,00.html">people who are homesick after the disaster.</a>

People have wasted no time in pointing out the political implications.  <a href="http://www.americablog.com/2011/03/gop-budget-would-cut-tsunami-warning.html">The GOP would cut tsunami prepardness out of the US budget</a>, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/12/earlyshow/saturday/main20042459.shtml">building codes saved Japan</a>.  While this author is somewhat sympathetic to the latter, it's foolish to believe that human beings can do something to stop death.  Granted tsunami preparedness may help (though native tribes never had a problem with tsunamis; when the birds start flying away from the water, so did the people).  Building codes could and do prevent structural damage sometimes.  But if your wave is big enough or your earthquake strong enough, it won't completely stop people from getting hurt.  Human beings can never fully master nature.  We can protect ourselves against some things, but some large disasters will kill.  We're vulnerable and it seems that people who are now making the arguments for more spending on building codes and tsunami preparedness aren't focusing on how these things by themselves can mitigate damage; they seem to have an implicit belief that human beings can tame nature completely.

Building codes and funding don't stand up to a power that can shift an entire coastline several feet.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>When was Jesus Christ Really Born?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Written around Christmas, this article intends to document the true birth of Christ. Not all of my readers believe in Christ but I'm sure that a number of non-believers can agree on two premises. First, the holiday should be more than just about buying things. Setting aside time to remember what's important is not a bad thing. Second, the Christian faith has had a large impact on our civilization. Understanding it will help us understand the history of the civilization, which will benefit any political project.

So as we approach the 25th, let's set aside some time to discuss the Christian meaning of the holiday. Many Christians celebrate Christmas as the birth of Christ even though most don't realize that He wasn't born on the 25th. Those that realize this will likely tell you that we can't really know when His birthday was. That answer has always, in my opinion, demonstrated a lack of willingness to find out. I always want to ask, "How do you know you can't know for sure? Have you ever tried?" I know people mean well and that most aren't taught, but if the Word of God really is <i>the</i> Word of God, then we would expect that the creator of the universe wouldn't spend thousands of years predicting His own descent to the world, a couple decades living among humans in order to be murdered by them to raise from the dead to save the souls of all who believe, and just forget to mention when all this took place.

The Bible is clear that the birth of Christ took place September 29. Let's take a look.

Luke 1.5 states that Zacharias was a priest of the course of Abia. This was the eighth of the courses responsible for administering the temple as documented in I Chronicles 24.10. Courses were changed every week on the Sabbath and each course occurred twice in the year. When one keeps in mind that all the courses served together at the three Great Feasts, the first yearly date would fall between 12 and 18 Chisleu (December 6-12 in our calendar) and the second between 12 and 18 Sivan (June 13-19). The prophecy made to Zacharias about the conception of John the Baptist would have taken place between June 13th and 19th, for he was not administering at a feast. Being aged, it would likely have taken him a couple days to make the journey back home and since he could not leave on June 19 (it being a Sabbath), he would leave on the 20th and arrive on the 21st or 22nd. The conception of John took place almost immediately after, so likely on the 23rd or 24th of June. Once pregnant, Elizabeth hid herself for five months (Luke 1.24) and in the sixth month Gabriel visited Mary and she conceived (Luke 1.26-41).

The conception of Christ would then take place around December 25th.

The period of human gestation is about 280 days. It is safe to assume that a miraculous pregnancy is going to last 280 days, no more and no less. It is also safe to assume that the birth of the Lord would take place exactly 280 days from December 25th on September 29th because the 29th was the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles and because that day is also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a>, the Feast of Michael and All Angels. In particular the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles makes sense considering the words in Matthew 1.18 and John 1.4 where we're told that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. The word in the Greek phrase <i>kai eskenosen en hemin</i> maintains an implication of "tabernacle." The phrase should read "And tabernacled with us" and is corroborated by the fact that the word "tabernacled" is preserved in the R.V. margin.

This date, as opposed to winter, also makes sense from the circumstantial evidence we have in the Bible. First, shepherds and their flocks would not have been found abiding in open fields in December - there wouldn't have been any pasture. It was customary for them to withdraw in October or November. Second, in instituting a census, the Romans would have been doing something unpopular. Making people travel during the most inhospitable time of the year would have made the whole thing worse. Getting people to report to Jerusalem when many were already planning a trip there for the Feast of Tabernacles would have been significantly easier. Third, a woman nine months pregnant would not be able to make a considerable journey like Mary did in the dead of winter.

To read more about this and see a breakdown of the days, please reference E.W. Bullinger's work in Appendix 179 of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825421802?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0825421802">Companion Bible</a>.

So let the Christian remember December 25th as one of the most miraculous days in history, the day of the Conception, since the Biblical account of events makes it very likely that the 25th was the day of Conception rather than birth. The Christian can and should honor the 25th as a holiday, but they should know what really took place on that day.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>A Transparent Lie</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: We were promised transparent government. Gone were the days of Bush's lies, secret prisons, or fiery rhetoric. But now it seems that the American left's current messianic figure not only wants to touch your junk but also do away with transparent government.

WikiLeaks has been branded <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/30/3079962.htm?site=sydney">criminal</a> by people in the government. The honorable Representative Peter King has called on the administration to list the site as a terrorist organization, allowing the government to go after anyone who aids or supports them.

So I certainly won't say that I support them. In fact, I don't. I think leaking documents is dangerous, stupid, and doesn't help whatever cause you're working for. That said, this is a beast created by the very government that wants to stop it. The administration would do well to remember the supreme court's feelings about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States">Daniel Ellsberg</a> and that whole leaking-Pentagon-studies business. But of course, Daniel Ellsberg and WikiLeaks are separate cases.

Daniel Ellsberg wanted to stop war, which is always noble because identifying and going after enemies with force, violence, fear, etc. is bad. WikiLeaks wants to...I don't know, pursue some nebulous understanding of free press. But at this moment in time, it's clear that WikiLeaks is an "enemy of the United States" and that going after the site and its supporters with force, violence, fear, etc. is justified. It's clear: Daniel Ellsberg and WikiLeaks both defend liberal ideals. Daniel Ellsberg helped the New York Times. WikiLeaks... Well, WikiLeaks does it's own thing. The site poses a threat to power structures and doesn't lubricate the normal media channels so much as Ellsberg and his copy machine. It has made itself an enemy of the United States; Ellsberg, American soldiers who leaked prison abuse, or government bureaucrats who repeatedly talk to the press about confidential issues are clearly not enemies of the United States. Why?

There are two reasons.

First, liberalism isn't suited for government, but only opposition and revolution. Left to itself, liberalism always undermines whatever government is in power. Obama, the old messianic figure of the 2008 presidential elections, is now in power. Up until a couple of months ago, his party completely ran the show. Up pops WikiLeaks which broadcasts what happens behind the curtain - not of Democratic government but democratic government. And liberalism can't tolerate so many flagrant violations of its sacred dogma. So WikiLeaks continues to attract disgruntled bureaucrats. The government, naturally, will do what the government does and work to retain power. But we're all revolutionaries now and the measures to retain power become more extensive - and bizarre. Really, consider for a moment that a couple of journalists running a site in Switzerland can be targeted by the USFG for doing things that the New York Times wish it could do.

Second, other leakers operated through proper channels. A disgruntled bureaucrat would call a reporter and give them the scoop. That reporter would then publish a story and get a nice check for being so popular. Going to WikiLeaks doesn't benefit any of our reporters; they get the story second-hand, when everyone else does. In simple terms, there's rarely any penalty for playing one arm of the USFG against another.

But I, of course, disapprove of leaking. It's messy, and depending on the circumstances, may require a doctor's attention.

What do you think? Is the government right to lockdown WikiLeakers, or do they need to tolerate it?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Union &quot;Solidarity&quot; is a Contradiction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The concept of solidarity first had its origins in the Christian faith.  We see in John 10.27 that the sheep of God know His voice and He knows them.  Many have quoted Romans 5.12-6.5 to show that the faithful are united with Adam and united in Christ.

The argument is as follows.  We are all children of God, born of woman, and we unite in fellowship in the family first, then the community.  Through the community we are connected to our government, and through that the world.  We have, then, solidarity with the world as all being children of God.  We may fight and quarrel, but that similtude of our common origin and common nature creates the possibility of a fellowship that can be brought about through grace.

The Unions in Wisconsin have claimed a solidarity of a different kind.  They raise signs asking for Democrats and Republicans to unite, they claim solidarity with other union workers, they claim solidarity with Egypt, they claim solidarity with the working class of the entire world.

How can socialist solidarity bring human beings together in a universal fellowship?  It cannot.  It is missing the crucial steps, and that crucial foundation.  Socialist solidarity tells us that human beings are all one and the same, of the same nature and origin, and that we're capable of a unity in that nature.  Socialist solidarity, however, denies the borders between nations, denies the substance of community, denies the family structure, and denies our heavenly origin.

The Christian faith teaches us that human nature is flawed, but that through divine intervention we are made whole and good, and that this divine being has made Himself known to us through signs and miracles recorded throughout the ages.  The socialists tell us that human nature is flawed, but that our nature will redeem us.  There is no divine being that tells them this, no miracle to give them inspiration, no confirmed prophets.  The socialist faith is a strange and supernatural denial of all reality in exchange for a mythical future that must materialize out of nothing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: A new Basque party is emerging in Spain.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortu">Sortu</a> claims to reject the Basque separatist group ETA's violent methods.  ETA has routinely engaged in bombings and shootings in order to promote the formation of an independent Basque state.

Sortu has gone so far as to write its denunciations of violence into its charters, however their platform is identical to that of the ETA: let the Basque people have an independent state.

On February 24, 2011, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18229442">The Economist calls on Spain to not censure the party</a>, as many political leaders have debated doing.  They say that "bringing the political representatives of Basque militancy into the democratic light" is the best method for revealing any flaws in Sortu and to promote a full rejection of the violence practiced by ETA.  This can happen only in the ballot box, they say, but I argue that the main battle will be fought in the streets so long as ETA has boxes that hold ammunition.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Credit Where None is Deserved</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: A few sites that this author frequents have been saying that the events in Egypt are America's fault. America's excessive liberal foreign policy has created a crisis that we will likely try to solve with a larger dose of liberalism.

This view is understandable. The critics contend that the United States has been on top since 1945, the <i>supporters</i> say that America has been running the show since at least the early 1990's. It's hard not to say that the constant interventions of the world's largest power didn't at least contribute to the state of the world now.

Such a view gives the United States too much credit. It assumes an America that has the insight to create and promote social movements to victory, it assumes an America alert to the stirrings of individuals on the periphery of the "known world" by which policy makers mean those isolated from the immediate attention of the press, it assumes an America that at least has the potential to change the situation - the power to make it worse is the power to make it better. The Onion's analysis of the situation may me more accurate, which jokes that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/smart-qualified-people-behind-the-scenes-keeping-a,17954/">no such competence exists.</a>

So what could be behind the unrest in Egypt, Tunisia, and a few other places? Two things, primarily.

First, the earth is essentially a giant latrine where all of the matter that was or could be unfit to be in the presence of the divine is dumped. Some people can swim, or at least tread water, while others sink to the bottom. A lot sink. With about 6.9 billion people running around, we have more human beings on the planet than ever before. Which means we also have more sinkers than before. If people have an opportunity to smash the state, the economy, or their neighbor's face, they usually take it.

Second, the toxic mingling of democracy and liberalism has created places where there are plenty of opportunities to smash. Prior to colonization, the Middle East was subject to the slow decay of the Ottoman Empire and a few states run by people who kept the masses down. When colonization happened, these masses were kept down by Europeans. Some argue that this was good, most argue that it was worse, but all agree that the masses were kept at bay by force. Throughout this time, people from the colonized states were educated in western schools where they were taught that ethnic groups should have their own state and rights were bestowed by the government. With the great purging that took place in the 1940's, nobody really had the energy to maintain their empires, so they began to hand them over to the masses. Naturally these masses were disgruntled (it's the default state for masses) and they gravitated to their educated family members who preached a new faith. Nationalism and a longing for the old empires fueled pan-Arabism, pan-Africanism, and other pan-ickisms. Nationalism plus a religious framework that rejected the decadent west created a pan-Islamism that is currently behind some of the movements.

We could blame the US for number two. The US did advocate and push for de-colonization. They also jumped on the liberal-democratic bandwagon and tried to promote it, but I disagree with the argument that we created it. The United States was very provincial when it had its revolution. People were focused on family, faith, and townships. The phrase "United States" was used in the plural (e.g. "The Unites States is at war" vs. "The United States are at war") until Lincoln's presidency. America's "liberalism" was not the liberalism of the 19th century that called for a dissolution of borders and complete free trade. Americans liked their borders, or we should say, Virginians, Georgians, and Pennsylvanians liked their borders. Nationalism was birthed with Napoleon and Bismarck, liberalism with Acton and Say. It was only after America destroyed local community did it join the new faith, and then proceeded to slaughter any who <i>appeared</i> to go against it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Spirit of Modernity Peeks Through Modern Art</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/culture/arts/the-spirit-of-modernity-peeks-through-modern-art</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: This article discusses a debate that took place over at <a href="http://www.halfsigma.com/2010/12/landscape-paintings-and-christianity.html">Half Sigma</a>. That is, the nature of art. Half Sigma makes a few interesting points:

1. The art of modern times is degenerate.
2. The theological basis of the modern ideologies would seem to call for a certain type of art (realistic depictions of nature) that we aren't seeing.
3. The art of modern times is devoid of spiritual significance because the modern ideologies hate and seek to stamp out the individual.

There were, naturally, people who disagreed. Some argued that modern photography presents itself as a feasible substitute to realistic landscapes, which are now made to look like cheap copies. Others argued that art cannot be political. Still more argued that Half Sigma was blowing things out of proportion.

This author's initial argument was such that modern art, when it depicts the real world, distorts it because the spirit of the artist is distorted but also because the theological basis of modern ideologies takes seriously the command "Thou shalt make no graven images." This was where Half Sigma made the response that the modern ideologies stamp out the individual.

After careful thought, we may conclude that Half Sigma is correct to say that the art of modern times is degenerate, that there is a theological basis to modern ideologies, and that modern ideologies are malignant in their aims. However, we must disagree as to the nature of the theology, which leads me to come to different conclusions about the left's treatment of the individual.

(As far as art not being political, this was thoroughly debunked by this author's and SFG's efforts in our demonstrations of Michelangelo and Picasso.)

The theological basis of modernity is the promise that individuals shall be as gods. The fact that diverse ideologies have arisen that <i>seemingly</i> stand for different ends does not matter. The radical individualism of classical liberalism vs. the radical collectivism of socialism are one in the same in that both are a radical shift to the carnal. As other articles have alluded to, classical liberalism inevitably leads to socialism. It will be difficult for people to accept this argument, true, but it will be even more difficult to say that this movement is not devoid of a spirit. Even movements that explicitly deny the spiritual are, at their core, theological movements. The exploration of this issue is one of the primary reasons for this site, so a full explanation in this article is impossible, so instead let us briefly examine the spiritual nature of modern art.

First, take Paul Gauguin's 1889 painting, <i>The Vision after the Sermon. Jacob Wrestling with the Angel.</i> This painting shows a group of women praying around the image of a man wrestling with an angelic figure near a tree against a red background. Featured in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300055161?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300055161">Primitivism, Cubism, Abstraction</a>, this painting is discussed in a very revealing way. The authors write, "Although <i>The Vision</i> is often seen as a religious painting, I would argue that it is as much a manifesto of Gauguin's primitivism. It depicts a religious theme, yet it is not promoting religion or piety." [1] They say that the painter had a decorative and primitive base that was influenced by Breton art. Breton art, which influenced Gaugin's <i>Green Christ</i> and <i>Yellow Christ</i>, "became the focus of contemporary debates about the 'essence' or 'soul' of a race." [2] So while Gaugin is employing Judeo-Christian symbolism in his work, there is a different spirit at work. His work forms part of a foundation for a collective theology of a race as well as a flight from European culture as seen in the primitivist movement. The distortions - the discoloration of Christ, the disfigured bodies, the "primitive" look, are all evidence of a shift in Gaugin's spiritual being. One cannot say that the movement is devoid of spirit, for then he'd stay away from religious symbology altogether. Gauguin and others are featured in a chapter entitled "The Going Away" in which European artists were said to retreat from modern European society in order to connect with their artistic essence. This retreat into a wilderness is of course colonizing (the artists often turned foreign women into concubines), but also has its parallels in John the Baptist's retreat from corrupt Judean society, Christ's time in the wilderness, and the probationary period experienced by Israel after their escape from Egypt.

Next, we can look to Henri Matisse's 1905-6 <i>Joy of Life</i> which serves as a grotesque mirror into the soul of an age. Nude male and female bodies are running around with animals, one on the left seems to be squatted over and looks almost like one of the animals. The painting "combines two 'primitive' traditions: a classicized 'primitive', and a (supposedly) spontaneous <i>culte de la vie.</i>" [3] (49-50) This bears a relationship to Salon d'Automne who could be "identified with a Nietzschean cult of spontaneous individualism." [4] Matisse seeks to rework a theme of classical paradise. His is a reminiscence of a mythical past golden age, an Eden-like history. Here, however, two things confront us. First, we are faced with the fact that this paradise is not Eden. The authors of my text describe it as an idyllic, arcadian environment. The circle of bodies, the flutes, the open sexual activity implies a free spirited pagan setting. It is more Greek than anything. Second, this environment is transplanted into a modern time and place. One must never lose sight of the fact that Matisse, living in the early 1900's, has dedicated a portion of his life to painting a scene set in the distant past. Why? The mere fact of the painting's existence implies that the artist wants us to learn from the scene. What can we learn? First, we learn what life supposedly <i>should</i> look like. We should, apparently, be running free with the animals and having sex in public. This radical primitivism (and I'm justified in calling it that; the style is called "primitivism") is a revolt from contemporary society. This revolt holds anarchic elements; first, the ancient scene is transplanted to a modern age as a lesson and second, it challenges our conception of the paradisical past. This is not a picture of Eden, a perfect paradise later marred by sin, a place that is ideal but impossible to return to. This is a picture of a Greek past, a perfect paradise that human beings wrecked. If responsible for the wreckage, human beings could also be responsible for the rebuilding. It is a call to revolution, like so much else of modern art.

Let us now jump now to abstract art, though we could spend a good amount of time critiquing other primitivist paintings. Let's look now to Theo van Doesburg. Of particular importance is his 1917 work, <i>The Cow</i>. The original piece features four plates which Van Doesburg claims are "an object aesthetically transformed." The first plate is a realistic portrayal of a cow and each subsequent plate is a "transformation" of the cow into a more abstract picture until finally the cow is a bunch of rectangles. It is an abstracted cow portrayed in such a way to illustrate a <i>process</i> of abstraction. The authors of the afore cited text write:

"[T]he idea of abstraction as a process tends to involve a kind of essentialism [...] to entail the belief that a purer, or higher, or deeper, or more universal form of reality is revealed through the paring away of the incidental and 'inessential' aspects of things. Essentiallism of this kind takes its justification from the Platonic idea that there are fundamental entities or universals of which the things we encounter are simply imperfect or impure instances. In the early twentieth century spiritualist forms of Neo-Platonism were briefly fashionable in artistic circles. The pursuit of abstract art was thus associated by many practitioners and advocates with a kind of 'seeing through'; with the idea that the artist is one who penetrates the veil of material existence in order to reveal an essential and underlying spiritual reality." [5]

This means, of course, that abstraction can and often does symbolize a movement of the spirit. The process of doing away with the "inessential" aspects in order to uncover the "universal" sounds suspiciously Hegelian, since Hegel sought to do away with contingencies to find the universal movement of history. (For those not familiar with his writings, Hegel thought that history was a story of progress toward more and more consciousness; his writings inspired Marx.) However, we may disagree with the text where it implies that the artists were moving away from the physical. The Platonic system was fairly explicit in its conviction that the absolute nature of things cannot be known by the human mind. <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/Philosophy">Philosophy</a> could not come to a definitive answer concerning absolute justice, beauty, or other spiritual concept; it could only prepare the soul for an afterlife where comprehension of these things was possible. This new spiritualism is quite a different sort than that practiced by Plato. Its inquiry implies that the absolute nature can be seen, can be portrayed, and that the artist can act as a medium between the spiritual and the physical. To put it bluntly, the physical can comprehend the absolute nature of these concepts. The spiritual becomes superfluous. It is the classic utopian sermon of heaven on earth.

As the text makes clear, not all abstractions served (spurious) Neoplatonic ends. Some, such as Rodchenko, served "materialist, constructive work toward communist ends." [6] Of course, we could also discuss Kandinsky's Theosophism, but we can perhaps rest content knowing that abstract art is another instance of modern ideologies disturbing the souls of spiritually sensitive people. The Futurist movement, as well as several artistic films made in the Soviet Union all show the same thing: a new faith.

In conclusion, it is this author's opinion that Half Sigma holds the high distinction of being one of the few people willing to <i>seriously</i> engage liberalism's theological foundation. Many people use religious language as a cheap polemic against their opponent, with the "faith" in global warming, etc. This is irresponsible language. Half Sigma has recognized the theological foundation and seeks to understand its motives with a more mature eye. However the type of theology that's being identified is not entirely accurate. Its aims are different and perhaps more sinister than crushing the individual.

This author is not much fun in museums.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The American Association for the Advancement of Science met this year to investigate some issues before the scientific community.  One such issue that was raised was alchemy, a long debunked and dead branch of science that most people associate with quackery and magic tricks. <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/02/24/give-the-alchemists-their-credit/">Dr. Lawrence Principe of Johns Hopkins University, however, is attempting to revive alchemy.</a>  He believes that alchemists were genuine scientists who simply had flawed theories, and their reputation for trickery arose after people deliberately played tricks with alchemy in order to lend credibility to the new science of chemistry.

It seems a few things could be developing.  First, the "objective" sciences that gained prominence in the 17th century are failing to hold certain scholars' attention.  It may be that the great minds in these fields have long since died and current research simply explores niches, contests unimportant findings, and so forth.  At least this seems to be the case with some medical studies, where one author suggests that alcohol harms pregnant women while another claims that it helps them, and a third says it won't make a difference.  The academic climate may be faltering; no doubt there's talent in respective fields, but the incentives and freedom to allow that talent to grow aren't as strong as they once were.  Second, the political climate has called into doubt these sciences.  As this author will likely always maintain that there is no such thing as an "objective" science and that all science builds upon fundamental assumptions about the world.  These assumptions, call them faith, philosophy, or a priori givens, are inherently political and have consequences for how human society is structured (or not structured).  By constantly preaching that everything is relative, perhaps some people believe that everything really is relative - even the "objective" sciences.  Third, on the inverse, these sciences are still viewed as absolute.  They remain unquestionable, the underlying assumptions may not be challenged, and scientists need to prove or disprove something in order to keep their jobs, grant money, and their own confidence (people feel better when they accomplish things).  Disproving alchemy, or studying its failures, doesn't challenge any status quos.

Will such a revival provide any insights?  Unlikely.  The old sciences of alchemy and hermetics rested on very different assumptions about the world.  The English mystic Robert Fludd wrote that the mathematical approach taken by the new sciences like chemistry hinted at the "quantitative shadows" of nature.  They come close to truth and can sometimes attain a glimpse into the nature of a substance, but the alchemists and hermetics "grasp the very marrow of natural bodies."  The belief in a substance of nature, the belief that humans can know a concrete nature of a thing is very different from the falsifiable statistical analysis done by today's scientists.

Furthermore, alchemy held a certain mystical function in premodern thought.  As Eric Voegelin writes:

"Alchemy, however, while not a science, had an important function in the life of the spirit.  The Christian pneumatocentric attitude restricts the problem of the spirit and its salvation to the strictly human sphere; the more comprehensive problem of the life of the spirit in nature and of its liberation from matter, which is the concern of certain oriental religious movements, as for instance of Manichaeism, is suppressed; Christ is the Savior of mankind, not of nature.  This other side of the work of salvation had found, during the Christian centuries, its most important expression in the operations of alchemists; the alchemic opus was in substance the attempt to extend the work of salvation to matter." [169, volume 5]

In simpler terms, Christianity taught people about the salvation of their souls; alchemy was an attempt to extend salvation to the material world.  Voegelin goes on to say that when the mathematical sciences won the intellectual debate, the desire to spread salvation to the material world still existed and reappeared in future political movements.  Liberalism attempted to liberate humanity by controlling the material world and providing more "stuff" to people.  Socialism attempted to liberate humanity from material oppression by abolishing the state and artificial restrictions on supply.  National Socialism attempted to liberate humanity from racial impurity.  "The common factor" writes Voegelin "is the faith in intramundane salvation through human action that will defeat the iniquity of matter."  Or in simpler terms, a faith in a this-worldly salvation through a material alteration.

Alchemy needs no revival, Dr. Principe, it lives on in virtually every government in power today.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The United States and the United Nations are both united in their support of opposition groups in Libya.  President Obama is worried that Gaddafi will stay in power.  Rebel leaders want a no-fly zone.  We're told this is a democratic movement, a peaceful movement, and that Gadaffi is the aggressor.  As Mr. Moldbug has pointed out, it's practically unheard of to launch airstrikes on protestors.  Gaddafi is clearly the bad guy in the scenario: the UN reports that he's even recruiting child soldiers to fight rebel forces.  This is a war crime, according to the UN.

If you're curious, the Paris Principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups (from UNICEF) in February 2007 gives this definition of child soldier:

"A child associated with an armed force or armed group refers to any person below 18 years of age who is, or who has been, recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, spies, or for sexual purposes.  It does not only refer to a child who is taking, or has taken, a direct part in hostilities."

In the narrative the White House and liberal groups have told, the revolutions throughout the Middle East are cases of good vs. evil.  The evil people are always those in power - the dictators, the torturers, the people who recruit child soldiers.  The good people are the opposition forces who always stand for human rights, democracy, and freedom.  Never mind that <a href="http://czardonic.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/libya-gaddafi-socialism-and-colonialism/">Gaddafi's regime is attempting an Arab version of democratic socialism</a>.  Never mind that <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/7320/World/Region/US-struggles-to-understand-Libyan-opposition.aspx">nobody in the west understands what the opposition stands for</a>.  And certainly never mind that <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18338840?story_id=18338840">the opposition is recruiting child soldiers</a> which are simply reported as "recruits" by the Economist.  Human rights only apply to the good people, or more insidiously, to humans.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: This picture is revealing in a number of ways.  It clearly shows the determination and fortitude behind Libya's opposition.  It shows strength, spirit, guts.  It shows, oddly, a glimpse of the truth: a woman, typically banned in Arab politics, is holding a sign written in a language spoken by only a handful of people in the country.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Which Witches?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There are many traditions that the American soul cherishes - baseball, apple pie, and an old fashioned witch hunt.  However, those who criticize witch hunts often engage in them themselves.

Mr. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-09/politics/king.profile_1_radicalization-muslim-community-muslim-american-community?_s=PM:POLITICS">has begun holding hearings</a> on "The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that Community's Response."  Mr. King hopes to root out the hidden terrorists in the Muslim community.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/adam_serwer_archive?month=01&amp;year=2011&amp;base_name=peter_kings_radicalization_hea">There are implications this is a witch hunt</a>.  <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18332766?story_id=18332766">The Economist compares Mr. King to Joseph McCarthy</a>.  Mr. King and the Republican Party suffer from "paranoid fantasies" about Muslim terrorists.

Last year, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/14/homeland-security-report_n_186834.html">DHS under Ms. Napolitano wanted to pursue right wing terrorists hidden among American communities</a>.  The public was told that these terrorists were forming militias aimed at toppling the state and committing hate crimes.  Hate crime legislation was passed earlier to more severely punish white-on-minority crime.  The current reactions to Mr. King are particularly revealing.  Mr. Richard Cohen at the Washington Post calls this whole thing "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/07/AR2011030704385.html">fuel for the bigots.</a>"  There's an implication that there's this hidden army of bigots at work in the American populace, secret McCarthys ready to strike at Muslims, blacks, and homosexuals if given a voice.  The New York Times calls the whole thing "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/opinion/08herbert.html">a violation of everything America is supposed to stand for.</a>"

Is it?

Dr. James Morone, a political scientist at Brown University in Maryland authored a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300105177/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorusorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300105177">Hellfire Nation</a>.  Dr. Morone suggests that political scientists often make the mistake of beginning their political analysis of American society with the American Revolution.  The real beginning of American political history begins with the first colonists.  Puritan America, contrary to Philadelphian America, is our true ancestry.  The Puritan quest for salvation through God has just as much influence on our political culture as secular liberalism.  What we see with the Puritans is a belief that hard work can reveal your fate in the afterlife.  Max Weber already discussed how the expansion of the Protestant ethic interacted with the growth of industrial capitalism; Dr. Morone argues that this process took place in the United States.  What also took place was the definition of a community based on an identification of an other.

All political societies identify an other; Athens identified themselves as Athenian by virtue of not being Spartan, Marxist enclaves identify themselves by not being part of the upper class, and Puritans identified themselves by not being heathen savages.  Their identity was deeply rooted in the Christian religion, but it suffered from a problem not encountered in England.  Puritans weren't persecuted in the New World.  In England, they could band together as being an underclass, a persecuted group, but in New England they were the ruling class.  They had the power to create and manage their own communities without interference, which contributed to a slight identity crisis.  No longer in a position to be identified as the persecuted saints waiting for redemption, the Puritans were on a divine mission in the wilderness to establish a biblical commonwealth.  The issues they encountered had to be interpreted in biblical proportions.

Dr. Morone argues that the Puritans had three classes of enemies: the external, the heretic, and the hidden.  The external enemies were Native American groups, viewed by the Puritans as agents of Satan.  They were a reminder of what the Puritans would become absent Christian virtue.  The heretics were people like Anne Hutchinson and the Quakers; Christians who strayed from the path.  The hidden enemies were the witches - agents of Satan that masqueraded as normal, God-fearing people.  Dr. Morone suggests that the identification of witches only took place near the end of the Puritan political experiment.  When the political structure of the covenant community was replaced by direct governorship of the British crown, the individual communities were lost.  The myth of a biblical commonwealth was being challenged, and so they began identifying hidden internal enemies to root out.  Dr. Morone almost seems to suggest that this was part of a last ditch effort by the Puritans at remaining a political community.

Witch hunts take real, credible threats and turn them into panics.  They are not about terrorists, right wing militias, or witches.  They are signs of a political community struggling to retain its identity.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Apology of St. Paul</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Christian apologetics is a very misunderstood field.  Secularists will either pay it no heed or assume that apologetics must conform to secularism in order to be valid (i.e. to depart from the faith).  Apologetics is always that bridge between faith and reason, which may have been true at a point in time when reason was tied to an overarching metaphysical view.  The old philosophers reasoned as much about justice as they did the nature of the divine; for them, the realm of the mind contained spirit and intellect.  In a world devoid of spirit, a compromise with the cult of reason may lead to a compromised faith.

The Bible, the Christian's guide to interacting in the world, should provide some guidance on how to deal with a reason that rejects the spiritual.  A few verses are quoted in support of modern apologetics: Isaiah 1.18, I Peter 3.15, Acts 17.17, and Romans 1.19-23 are used to justify the compromise with reason.

Isaiah 1.18 reads "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

The apologist will argue that this reads as an invitation to discuss and debate, a clear support of the idea of reasoning to strengthen the faith.  Yet the first chapter of Isaiah contains a different message.  Verse two calls the people to hear what "the LORD hath spoken" because the people are rebellious.  Isaiah exhorts the people to examine their situation because their sins are as un-mended sores that bleed and puss all over.  They are so corrupt that the sacrifices even offend the Lord.

The solution is provided in verse 18 with the call to approach the Lord to "reason together."  The rest of the verse shows that the context is a redemption of promises.  The believer is supposed to discuss the covenant with God; the new covenant (testament) is the forgiveness of sins on the condition that the individual believes on Christ.  Even though we are not worthy, God keeps his word to the believers but asks to be reminded of it, presumably to see if we have heard the promise.  The Hebrew word <i>yākach</i>, which is translated as "reason together" is a primitive root meaning "to be correct" and has the connotation of a decision.  God has decided, but the condition is the approach of the believer and the believer's "willingness and obedience" as expressed in the next verse.

Isaiah 1.18 is a call to discuss with God a faith already possessed so that we may be obedient and receive the promise.  This is not a call to reason with the unbelievers to persuade them of the faith.

I Peter 3.15 reads "But sanctify the LORD God in your hears: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear."

Here the apologist will argue that we must reason with "every man that asketh" in order to persuade him of the faith.  Yet this is again taken out of context.  The prior verses 8-14 advise the faithful to avoid seeking revenge on people who do evil.  The Lord will punish the transgressors and reward those who do right, Peter tells us, and if the faithful strive to do only good then those that harm them are obviously transgressors for evil is the only objection to good.  The believers are told not to worry about suffering.

Verse 15 is how the believer should respond: give an account of the hope in their hearts in a gentle way.  This will shame the evil doers and expose them as evil.  In the following couple of verses, Peter advises the church that they shouldn't be afraid to die for God.  Verse 15 is advising the believer when they are persecuted.

Acts 17.17 reads "Therefore disputed he [St. Paul] in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."

If anything ought to inspire the apologists, it should be this verse.  Clearly St. Paul is engaging a debate with non-believers in order to convert them.  And he is, but there are a few caveats.  St. Paul has arrived in the city of Athens (verse 15) and he has gone to two locations - the synagogue and the market, and he has conversed with two sets of people - Jews and devout persons.  St. Paul is in the city of the philosophers "disputing" which in the Greek is <i>dialegomai</i>.  He is where Socrates was, engaging in dialogues.  However, he has not gone to any philosophical school, but instead to the town square and a religious institution.  He has also avoided talking to philosophers and instead talks to people of faith.  Like Socrates, he was in the company of ordinary people.

Enter the philosophers in the following verse.  "Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him.  And some said What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."  They then seize him and take him to Areopagus, where the main council met and they demand to know the new doctrine.  St. Paul tells them and most of them mock him.  It is those without faith who turn away from him, but a few believed.

The Epicureans (who held that pleasure was the highest good, much like today's utilitarians) and the Stoics (who thought that we should be divorced from all feeling) are those who mock the apostle.  This is the only place where the Greek word <em>philosophos</em> "philosophers" is used in the Bible and it is in a context of confrontation.  This is not, however, the only place where he disputes with the Greeks.  In Acts 9.29 he boldly disputes with Greeks at Jerusalem and the situation gets so heated that St. Paul's friends must remove the apostle from the city before the Greeks kill him.

All of this knowledge probably helped fuel the sentiment that Paul had when he wrote in Colossians 2.8 "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."  This is the only place in the Bible where the Greek word <i>philosophia</i> is used.

Romans 1.19-23 reads "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."

This should probably serve as a warning against apologetics, if the effort of apologetics is an attempt to justify theology before the court of philosophy.  The word "imaginations" in the King James in verse 21 means "reasonings."  It would then read, "Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened."  Essentially, a failure to understand the timeline of divine creation (II Peter 3:5-8)  is the trigger for vain reasonings, which Paul goes on to impact out to promiscuity, murder, and all kinds of other negative things.  The Greek assumption about the creation is that it didn't happen; the world is eternal under those systems.  The sentiment is present in Machiavelli and other moderns who have taken it from the ancient tradition.

St. Paul attempted to bring Christianity to non-believers by trying to make sense of it within their civilizational paradigm.  He didn't demand that the pagan follow the Law of Moses, he merely pointed the way to the truth.  This was not done because he believed that the pagans stood on equal ground with the Christian community, but because he expected Christianity to fundamentally transform individual souls, so that the paganism would fall away.  For St. Paul, that was the sole purpose of apologetics - it was to demonstrate the superiority of the Christian faith because the faith is the only consistent and effective answer to the world.

His speech at Athens was revealing, for he tells the story of coming upon an altar dedicated to "THE UNKNOWN GOD."  St. Paul claims that the Greeks were worshiping God but did not know the holy name.  They wanted to find God but could not and through Christianity are the myths fulfilled.  Oddly, there are signs that the New Testament provides an answer to questions that troubled to Greek and Roman minds.  In chapter 9 of the book of Acts, the power of Christ works through St. Peter to heal Aeneas.  Aeneas had been sick for some time, but was healed with Christ.  Aeneas, of course, shares his name with the Roman hero in Virgil's Aeneid.  The sickly hero, or the old faith, fails to inspire.  Only the power of Christ can infuse heroes, for their heroism happens only with God's permission and grace.  Further, the journey of St. Paul seems to mimic Odysseus.  St. Paul too is journeying home, but home for him is a closer bond with the divine.  Through his journey, St. Paul is beaten, imprisoned, and shipwrecked.  Like Odysseus he overcomes.  At the end of his ministry, St. Paul is utilized to break the Greek tradition, however.  Like Socrates, St. Paul is arrested by the authorities.  Like Socrates, the authorities demand an account from him.  Like Socrates, the word <i>apologeia</i> is used to describe his defense of himself.  Unlike Socrates, the apostle walks away with his life and a free hand to spread the truth.  Worldly powers are nothing to the divine.  Truth can be pursued, but always the chosen vessels of Christ are guided through the world's troubles.

The lesson is made evident in the Gospel of John.  There Christ is described as the Word made flesh.  This word, "Word" in Greek is <i>logos</i>; the same word used for "reason".  Human knowledge always reaches a limit because of our distance from the divine; human knowledge that fails to acknowledge the divine simply fails.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Book Review: Leo Strauss&#039; Persecution and the Art of Writing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Thoughts on Strauss</b>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Due to his unique style of writing, the late Dr. Leo Strauss is associated with everything from neoconservatism to anti-democratic subversion.

If one is to take the popular opinion, Leo Strauss is either a bumbling idiot or the mastermind of the neoconservative movement. Strauss is a careful reader, and it's doubtful that a careful reader can be an idiot (though he can be bumbling). So perhaps Strauss is a mastermind. I possess one book that can claim to be neoconservative, which is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802141935/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802141935">The Neocon Reader</a>, compiled by Irwin Stelzer. Stelzer claims of his book that it is a collection of writings by a "loose-knit band of intellectuals and politicians" so one would expect to find major neoconservative intellectuals within its covers. And it should be noted that this is not a polemic text, but is one compiled by a self-proclaimed neoconservative. What the neoconservative claims is neoconservative should be given more weight than what the non-neoconservative says is.

Leo Strauss is not the author of any of the 24 essays therein. What we do have is one author, Irving Kristol, who reportedly studied under Strauss and we have mention of Strauss on page 317 where he is listed as one of the "Scholars and Others Mentioned." It says there of him, "Political philosopher and teacher at the University of Chicago after escaping Nazi persecution." Other mentions of Strauss occur on pages 22, 35, 51, 203-12, and 245-9. Let us examine each.

On page 22 we are told by Stelzer that Strauss's views were not important in the development of neo-conservatism. Immediately following we are told that "The political roots of neo-conservatism may fairly be said to lie on the left of the ideological spectrum." Strauss would then be important if his teaching was on the left of the ideological spectrum.

On page 35 Irving Kristol tells us that "The favorite neoconservative text on foreign affairs, thanks to Professors Leo Strauss of Chicago and Donald Kagan of Yale, is Thucydides on the Peloponnesian War." What we have are a few key ideas from this text, one of which is "patriotism is a natural and healthy sentiment, and should be encouraged by both private and public institutions." What we must take from this is that Strauss would be important for neo-conservatism if he agreed with the Athenian argument that national interest trumps other concerns and that patriotism is healthy.

On page 51, Max Boot shows us a few things. He says that critics of neo-conservatism charge that "the spirits of philosopher Leo Strauss and Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky" guide the neocon movement and promote "contempt for the democratic masses." Boot claims that Strauss believed in American ideals and thought them worth defending at home and abroad. He describes Strauss as "A largely apolitical Professor of Classics at the University of Chicago" and that "He was a firm believer in U.S. democracy." "Strauss's views inspired some early neocons; few read him today" he concludes. One must therefore say that Strauss is only marginally important to neo-conservatism if he defended the democratic masses and was a firm believer in democracy. But even so, he only apparently inspired first generation neocons.

On 203-12, we have an essay by Kenneth R. Weinstein discussing "Philosophic Roots, the Role of Leo Strauss, and the War in Iraq." After the War in Iraq, western press agencies attacked Strauss as the force behind the war, since he apparently supported the Socratic notion of a noble lie (a falsehood aimed at societal cohesion). As Weinstein pointed out, Strauss has been dead since the 70's and had no opinion on Saddam Hussein. Most of the ideas about Strauss being the godfather of neo-conservatism come from Lyndon LaRouche who "paraphrases the work of Shadia Drury, a professor of political theory [...] who has made it her life's work to attack Strauss." The author lists several of Strauss's students in Democratic and Republican administrations. Strauss, according to Weinstein, was devoted to liberal education and offered no political program; he simply read books. The last reference to Strauss again is in connection to LaRouche.

We can take away a few things from this. First, the neoconservatives deny that Strauss was a major influence. If we should disbelieve them, we would argue that Strauss was an influence only if he met the above criteria. If that was his true teaching, then he was an influence.

<b>The Book</b>

The Introductionto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226777111/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0226777111">Persecution and the Art of Writing</a> presents us with Strauss's purpose. Interpreting texts belongs to the sociology of knowledge, and no one today is able to engage in a correct study of old authors because their methodology is off. Modern historians attempt to understand authors better than they understood themselves, Strauss seeks to understand them as they understood themselves. The Introduction shows us that philosophers are one class of people and that surface-level differences between different authors disguises that they are all individual links in a chain of tradition that spans centuries.

Strauss presents his book according to the methodology of Jewish scholars, perhaps because Strauss was Jewish or his interest touched on Jewish medieval philosophy. The recognition of Strauss as a Jewish author is not meant to cast doubt on his claims by appealing to anti-Semitism, nor is it to believe that Strauss is not important because of his religious connection. In order to understand Strauss's teaching, one needs to be aware of his connection to Jewish thought.

Strauss appears then to view philosophic works as authored by individual authors, just as he points out that Spinoza viewed books of the Bible as being written by individual authors. Each author contains a particular message that may contradict other authors and it is important to understand that message as the author understood it. The three primary authors discussed in Persecution - Maimonides, Halevi, and Spinoza, all believed that Biblical teachings could contain a surface-level and a deeper message. The surface-level teaching serves the purpose of conveying a particular truth as well as covering up the esoteric teaching from the unlearned. Maimonides in particular uses the recognition of an esoteric message to examine the Bible in an esoteric way. Likewise, Strauss continues the tradition by examining Maimonides in an esoteric way. One is always presented with an esoteric interpretation of an esoteric text, which on occasion is an esoteric interpretation of another esoteric text. By paying attention to internal contradictions one can reach an understanding of the true messages contained in all of these works.

Each of the three authors Strauss examines at length (as well as Al Farabi, who he talks about in the Introduction) attempt to grasp the conflict between Athens and Jerusalem, which is to say Philosophy and Faith. This conflict is approached by each author in a particular esoteric fashion since they all lived in times where they might be persecuted for their thoughts. It therefore becomes clear that each author is reaching conclusions that contradict the common opinion of their times. Each reconciles philosophy with faith, though some have argued that they have subordinated faith to philosophy or philosophy to faith. The reader must pay attention to Strauss's own illuminations before understanding the intent of the authors, and even then the reader ought to understand the differences between Strauss's quotations from the text and the actual text that's quoted.

Strauss is not light reading. Persecution provides a manual for understanding his other works. Any review of his work has to, according to the restraints he places on readers and the nature of his messages must be just as circumspect.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Marine Le Pen&#039;s Crude Message</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: It seems that the 20th century, with its long and terrible efforts at repressing the right, has failed to completely purge Europe of its conservative elements.

This author has a history of getting nervous whenever the "far right" is mentioned by major news sources.  Typically it isn't the far right being discussed at all.  He also gets even more nervous when this "far right" grows in popularity, because democratic support tends to corrupt genuine counter-revolutionaries.  In several parts of Europe, nevertheless, The Economist has reported that "the populist far right" is on the move.

The message of these parties - that European countries should be wary of cooperation with the European Union since a currency crisis would endanger everyone, that European states ought to worry about opening their borders up to the Middle East and North Africa because for better or worse mass immigration from one place or another leads to violence, and that order is generally preferable to disorder - naturally upset the sensibilities of the paper.  The editors <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18389008?story_id=18389008">call on parties and voters</a> to "counter [...] its crude message" rather than "pander" to it.  In particular, the paper speaks out against Ms. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front.  Ms. Le Pen speaks frighteningly of the "Islamification of Europe," globalization, the "height of barbarity" that was the Holocaust, and does so in an ominous "<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18398631?story_id=18398631">traditional Catholic overtone.</a>"

These parties have appealed to older voters, which is a little perplexing.  If in fact distance from the 20th century numbs us to its horrors, since it's very easy to oppose ideologies that sound fascist or communist when you were alive to see the camps (or were told about them by your parents), we would expect young people to be drawn to people like Ms. Le Pen if her party really is reminiscent of repressive, intollerant groups. Or perhaps these voters are more concerned about the collapse of Europe than they are neo-fascism?

People like Ms. Le Pen are not a revolutionary force, nor a reactionary force, but a conservative force.  They are the last vestige of the nation-state; they are its final defenders.  They appear to the liberal Economist as bearers of a crude message only because the editors, most of the readers, and the rest of the world have silently abandoned the nation-state as a political idea.  Since 1945 and the end of the "height of barbarity" Ms. Le Pen rightfully acknowledges, society has been too exhausted to defend the nation-state - and too frightened of its autonomy to try.  In our new political world, human rights and the progression toward world cooperation are the new forms of legitimacy.  Ms. Le Pen is a dying breed, an outcast, and at a loss for how to articulate the collapse her constituents have witnessed.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Members of the US Congress are feeling left out of the reindeer games in Libya.  It seems they actually believe the illusion that sovereign power resides in the three branches of the US Federal Government.

Dr. Ron Paul and Mr. Dennis Kucinich, no doubt the sterling representatives of America's ruling class, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-pn-obama-congress-libya-20110323,0,3736720.story?page=1&amp;logout=true">are complaining</a> that President Obama's decision to launch a strike against Libya may have been unconstitutional.

The real news here is not that American presidents engage in military action without Congressional approval.  This has been done scores of times.  The real news also, is not (not even for the press), that President Obama seems to be using the hapless Libyans to boost his popularity.  Of course <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/21/cnn-poll-so-far-obama-gets-no-bounce-from-libya/">some have hinted</a> that there should be an increase.  And it's certainly no small irony that this comes on the heels of The Economist <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18388914">accusing the administration of being cowardly</a>.  As the LA Times cited above indicates, the timid opposition still feels that the president is weak since the French got there first.  The news is also not that everyone in the government has thus far tacitly approved of the Libyan expedition - Dr. Paul and his merry men - by arguing that the President needed approval implies that with approval this would be a legitimate thing to do, the GOP when they imply that if President Obama dispatched troops sooner it would be ok, and everyone else who woke up one day to find themselves bombing another country.

No, the real news is that people assume the Constitution has any sway over the day to day operations in the Beltway.

Three groups made the decision to intervene in Libya: the media, non-governmental organizations, and the State Department.  The rubber stamp from the United Nations (which merely indicated that China and Russia, the last potential outposts of independent decision making outside the United States, had no material objection to the matter) was superfluous.

First, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_branch_of_government">media</a>.  This group selectively reported negative actions done by the Libyan government and explicitly ignored issues like the <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/enemies-humanity">recruitment of children soldiers by the opposition group</a>.  They also failed to investigate what the opposition group is about.  As this author has posed on Twitter, what do you know about the Libyan opposition?

Second, NGO's.  <a href="http://www.progressivefix.com/where-do-ngos-stand-on-intervening-in-libya">This article is revealing</a>.

Third, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/03/09/state-department-declines-libyan-conflict-civil-war/">the State Department</a>.  The United States has a long-standing tradition of refusing to take sides in a civil war.  So leading up to the conflict, the State Department had to regulate the terms used to describe the situation in Libya.

Those who predict the action, frame the action, and promote the action are those who made the decision to undertake the action.  The pre-meditation for the murder came out of these organs - once they were set into motion, it was a matter of time before the DOD folks were called into play.

(And while members of Congress still remain confused about who runs the show, the realities of US sovereignty <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/what-propaganda-looks">are not lost on the Libyans</a>.)]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The Spanish philosopher Donoso Cortes wrote that monarchy was destroyed by freedom of speech just as democracy will be destroyed by bankruptcy. We must remember this as battles over spending reach the capitals of major democratic governments around the world.

In the United States, the governor of the state of Wisconsin has been battling labor unions to save the state budget. Governors of other states have engaged in similar struggles. Labor unions themselves have promised to politically destroy these proclaimed enemies of the working class.

In Great Britain, approximately 500,000 friends of labor smashed windows, vandalized property, and protested spending cuts that would hurt their bottom line.

In right-wing circles, it's generally acknowledged that entitlement programs will bankrupt the state. As the so-called "baby boomer" generation retires, there will be more people drawing on pension benefits than working to supply them. Medical costs will also increase, as the elderly have more issues to tend to than the young. There are calls for cuts, but there are a few reasons why cuts won't happen.

1. The short-term nature of democracy. Crowds are fickle. A politician in a democracy has to cater to the crowd or he or she will lose their job. As such, the decision horizon of a politician is limited to the immediate election cycle. Further, as the Kingdon model demonstrates, what issues actually come before elected officials are decided almost arbitrarily based on the news, public opinion, or trends in policy making. Nobody wants to worry about a problem that's ten years down the road.

2. The funding mechanisms within democracy. Democratic power rests on votes of interested people. The usual myth is that majorities win. This is not true in modern government. Now, majorities don't care. Vested and vocal minorities make policy decisions. These vocal minorities can control the narrative that shapes public opinion by convincing the broader public to become interested in an issue. But it's all about the smaller groups. In modern democratic government, there are four ways of funding programs. First, the government taxes everyone to pay for one group's benefits. Second, the government taxes a small group to pay for another group's benefits. Third, the government taxes everyone to pay for everyone's benefits. Fourth, the government taxes a small group to pay for everyone's benefits. The model depends on a loose definition of "tax"; here it means any money extracted by the government. The easiest programs to pass are ones that tax everyone to benefit a small group; the small group is vocal in their support of the law, and everyone else is either convinced of the merits or somewhat apathetic of the new spending since the costs are distributed over a large number of people. Likewise, these are the hardest to repeal. The small group will always fight to defend their privileged position, whereas the broader public isn't as impassioned.

3. The decision criteria for democracy. Liberal democracies rest on a utilitarian basis. The ideas of John Stuart Mill, his father, and Jeremy Bentham matter. The numbers game that the utilitarians play to reach some tenuous understanding of justice directly impacts decision making today. In public policy circles, everything centers on costs vs. benefits. In an abstract way, the metaphysical existence of liberal democracy is all about money. This means that what kills it will be money. The metaphysical basis of monarchy was faith and honor. When these two things were corrupted, monarchy failed. Perhaps not now, in this crisis, but definitely at some point in the future, money will fail the liberals.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Carl Schmitt once said, "Tell me who your enemy is and I'll tell you who you are."  Westerners haven't and won't listen to Schmitt's wisdom when looking at the revolutions in the Middle East because the truth is uncomfortable.

The Economist recently ran an article pointing out that Islam will play a greater role in Arab politics than in other countries.  This author is still a little perplexed at how this is news, but he trusts that the editorial board knows what they're doing.  The article discusses the role that the Muslim Brotherhood has had in the recent uprisings.  In particular, it's mentioned how the Brotherhood has reassured the West as to its relationship with the extreme jihadists in the region.  The Brotherhood, it's said, supports parliamentary government, women's rights, and other liberal values.

The media in liberal democratic countries have accepted this narrative about the Brotherhood.  Why?  They have their theory about world history and the information that actually comes to their attention is bent to conform to the theory.  The theory is that revolutions are uprisings against illegitimate oppression and result in more democracy as part of progress' unfolding plan.  In a Huntington-style wave, country after country has had a revolution.  Adherents to particular ideologies explain their reality by fitting events into their ideological theories.

But is this true?  Saul Alinsky, both one degree of separation from Satan and the current American President, would probably be the first on the left to point out that the Muslim Brotherhood is just being smart.  Alinsky argued that Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. were only non-violent because they didn't have enough guns.  When you think you can win a shooting war, you have no problem waging a shooting war.  When you think you'll lose, you make do and find other ways.  The Brotherhood can't come out and say that they're the same radical group that's been blacklisted in every secular Middle Eastern government and that they have a history of advocating strictly Islamic, non-pluralistic government - and they certainly can't discuss their dream of a united Muslim state.  If they said these things, they would be left alone waging a shooting war against governments that have more guns.

As Half Sigma points out, heads of state in this part of the world actually take their religion seriously.  When religion is turned into a political force, the religious community begins to identify political enemies based on religion.  Make no mistake; efforts to empower revolutionaries will enable them to destroy the enemies of Islam.  Unfortunate for our well-meaning friends in the media because they are on the radicals' short list.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Politics is theology.  If the neo-Marxists Hardt and Negri have <a href="http://ttp/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143035592/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorusorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0143035592">embraced the swarm metaphor</a> and have encouraged revolutionaries to adopt it as their own, the opponents of revolution should look for the parallel theological metaphor to understand the conflict.
<b>The Four Stages of the Locust and the Political Theology of the Swarm</b>

The current wave of uprisings is being described as many things.  Some call it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584350806/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorusorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=1584350806">insurrection</a>.  Others might term it a democratic wave in light of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806125160/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorusorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0806125160">Samuel Huntington's work</a>.  More call it a movement and a trend.  We call it a swarm because we prefer to take people at their word.  When the revolutionaries themselves adopt a metaphor to describe their actions, the metaphor should be examined and taken seriously.  We have much to learn by understanding the religious significance of "the swarm".

We find swarmers mentioned in the Book of Joel where the prophet discusses the four stages of the locust.  There, God states "That which the palmerworm hat left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hat the caterpiller eaten."  (Joel 1.4) We are given here four stages of the locust's life, as well as the truth about revolutionary movements.  Each revolutionary stage advances by consuming the remains of its predecessors.  Just as fire glows only when it has something to burn, revolutions appear as progress only when they have something to destroy.  As for the four stages of the locust, the Hebrew is more exact.  It reads, "Gnawer's remnant, Swarmer eats; Swarmer's remnant, Devourer eats; Devourer's remnant, Consumer eats."  So we first have the gnawers, then the swarmers, then the devourers, and finally the consumers.  We are situated in the second stage with the self-proclaimed swarmers.

We find in Revelation 9.2-11 that the locusts ascend from the bottomless bit as an army.  They are given a set time to torment the earth and they have a leader who is identified as the "angel of the bottomless pit" whose name in both Hebrew and Greek translates to "Destroyer."  This Destroyer is likely to be none other than the devil himself.  I would tender this as a possibility in light of Proverbs 30.27 which states, "The locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands" since the devil is not here but in heaven (Revelation 12.7-10).  Until that time, the locusts are truly a decentralized force.

Though there is a move toward collectivization, a growing swarm-mentality, on the left, we would be wrong to assume that there was a present central leader.  Too often on the right, people look at a situation of destruction and assume that there must be a united central director - some cartel of bankers or members of a secret society.  The swarmers are unified in the sense that they swarm and destroy, but decentralized in that the will to destruction spreads as a virus from one region to another.  Whatever garb it might take, the will to destruction does not require an extensive ideology or articulated concept; it's an instinctual, base urge.

The swarm metaphor must not be overlooked.  Though revolutionaries since Proudhon have utilized religious symbolism, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/31067286/Marx-and-Satan-Richard-Wurmbrand">some have gone as far as to openly advocate worship of Satan</a>, this author is at a loss to find another instant where there was a religious parallel so strikingly similar to the political but existed without their knowing.  In simpler terms, the old revolutionaries knew they were perverting religious language.  The swarmers do not realize the theological metaphor that mirrors their actions.  The gnawers were conscious of their theology; the swarmers are oblivious to it. In each of the four stages of the locust, the swarm carries with it certain similarities but evolves into different levels of consciousness.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Not all is orderly in Japan. Beneath the surface, the locusts have begun stirring.

There has been <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2011/03/21/voices-from-inside-japan%E2%80%94no-panic-simply-strength-and-kindness/">much talk</a> of the relative calmness and order in Japan after the recent quake.  Granted, there has been.  Nobody's rioted, looted, or otherwise engaged in a general panic.  Even now, as conditions continue to be difficult and the country continues to be rocked by quakes, there is order.

But beneath the surface, rumors of uprising have begun.  The Socialist Worker Online, a self-described revolutionary anti-capitalist paper in Britain, <a href="http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=24452">has stated that the Japanese nuclear crisis has created social problems in the country</a>.  Distrust of the government and the feeling that the media has ignored the issues facing displaced people is leading to a renewed interest in anti-government politics.

This is echoed by The Diplomat which points out that <a href="http://the-diplomat.com/2011/03/30/japan%E2%80%99s-political-tremors/">the media is seen as in concert with the status quo powers</a>.  The fact that papers immediately sided with Washington instead of the Japanese government suggested that Japan was overseen by America and had little autonomy of its own.  As is typical, the magic dies once the man behind the curtain is revealed, and the Japanese have struggled against external forces telling them what to do and a government that seems ineffective at solving the current crisis.

People will continue looking for answers.  The media can't be trusted.  The government can't be trusted.  Washington, their real masters, are too far away.  As the political parties in Japan come together, <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/apr2011/japa-a08.shtml">the revolutionary groups will have a common enemy</a> - and <a href="http://climateandcapitalism.com/?p=3979">a common explanation</a>.  The order is illusory.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Revolution is a virus.  Once it infects the mind of one or two people, it can spread across an entire region without regard.  Echoing western policy makers, we may even say that it more adversely affects the poor and vulnerable.

The Syrian government has experienced formidable opposition from revolutionary groups.  You can read about the spread of the revolution in <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0415/Syrian-revolution-spreads-with-largest-protests-yet">this article</a>.

It is largely the same story as elsewhere: the underclass is rising up against autocratic government and demanding democracy.  Or so we're told.

The Monthly Review, a socialist publication, is fairly candid about what's going on.  <a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/abukhalil140411.html">The socialists point out</a> that there are essentially two opposition elements calling for democracy, and neither actually wants it.

First, there are the Syrian communists (which western media is aware are communists and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/opinion/11saleh.html?_r=1">lets them write opinion pieces</a>).  These Arab communists "fought for social justice, workers' victory, the dictatorship of the proletariat, revolution, and liberation but not for democracy."  The article takes a hardline stance, criticizing communist leaders who "can't stop invoking the discourse of democracy [...] religiously."

Second, there's the Muslim Brotherhood which also says that they want democracy.  But this publication, unlike much of the traditional media, <a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/abukhalil120411.html">has actually done their homework</a>.

There is no amiability between the Muslim Brotherhood and the socialists, but there is a common agenda of striking against the status quo.  The tame, multi-cultural, pluralist liberal democrats are nowhere to be found.

Of course, everyone forgets that the current Syrian state was a product of the swarm itself; its 1973 constitution defines it as a secular socialist state.  The revolution eats its own; the locust consumes the waste of its predecessors.]]></content:encoded>

<i>Dedicated to my father, a missionary in the wilderness.</i>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The theological category of the wilderness is often synonymous with punishment.  This most likely arises from God's banishment of Israel in the wilderness for forty years after they committed idolatry.

The wilderness itself is a neutral concept.  In Hebrew the word is <i>midbawr</i> and it comes from a root word relating to speach.  It is either speach to arrange and command, or speech to destroy.  <i>Midbawr</i> also means "a pasture where cattle are driven" and is only by implication a desert.  In Greek it is <i>eremia</i> and simply means "solitude."  We have three potential meanings for wilderness as it appears in scripture.  These cannot be accidental meanings, nor can we assume that God has overlooked these meanings when selecting the word.  The wilderness is a place where the children are driven forth, alone and separate from the rest of the world, and are subject to a particular form of speech.  This speech, of course, is the Word which is always present in the theological pasture.  The Word may either arrange and command or it may destroy.  Both this arrangement of order and destruction take place within the wilderness and Israel in the wilderness must confront both.

We can examine three primary instances of Israel in the wilderness in scripture to understand how the Christian should view it.

First, there's the story of Moses.  Moses lived to be 120 years old and his life was notable in that it was entirely controlled by God from birth.  The Egyptians conspired to kill the male Israelite children because the Israelites had become too numerous.  God directed Moses' mother to place the baby Moses in a basket and set it loose in a crocodile infested river.  Not only did Moses survive, but he was cared for by the enemy.

Moses spent the first 40 years of his life in Egypt under Pharoah's house.  In Exodus 2.11-12 Moses reacted to an injustice by committing an injustice.  In verse 14, the words of the Hebrew accusing Moses trigger the revenge from Pharoah and in turn drive Moses into the wilderness.  Moses must, for a time, be separated from the world because of what he had done.  His first time being driven into the wilderness was to atone for the wrong he had done.  While there, he did right by the Midianites and found refuge.  He lived among them, married one of them, and tended the sheep.  While tending the sheep in the desert (<i>midbawr</i>) he came to the mountain of God.

Here, then, is an interesting chain of events.  On one hand, Moses, intending to do right did wrong and was driven to the wilderness.  Yet in the wilderness he did right (defended the well, tended the sheep) and came to the mountain of God, which was situated in the very furthest part of the wilderness. <i>God speaks most clearly to Israel in the wilderness.</i>

On this mountain, Moses contends with the divine.  The speech from the Hebrew seemed arrayed to destroy him, but the speech from the Lord arranges and commands.  Yet Moses has difficulty believing that he is worthy; he's a wanted man, he has no ability, and he doesn't speak well.  After a time, Moses is sent anyway, but he is not ready.  The Lord goes to slay Moses' son who Moses has neglected to circumcise, but his wife performs the deed herself.  With the obedience to the commandments, Moses is ready.  But instead of sending Moses to Aaron, God has Aaron go into the wilderness to speak with Moses.  Only in the wilderness, in that solitude, is it proper to hear the unfiltered words of God.  Once the message is given, Aaron and Moses return to Egypt together.  Moses is 80 years old when he speaks with Pharaoh and frees the people (Exodus 7.7).

The people are freed.  To where?  The wilderness.  They too must go out of bondage to the wilderness, since the promised land lies on the other side.  Moses, having already been in the wilderness, was fit to lead the people through since he had been tried and justified.  We might almost be reminded of Plato's tale of the cave: men are in the cave (the wilderness) where they only see shadows and glimpses of light, while the few rise above and go out in the sunlight to see truth, but are obligated to go back in the cave in order to help others.  Moses too must go back in the wilderness to lead others through it.  In the end, Moses spends half his life in the wilderness but there was no other way to temper the man who was to lead the people to freedom.

Second, we have the brief encounter of John the Baptist.  Matthew 3.1 we find that John preached in the wilderness of Judaea.  This was the voice crying in the wilderness spoken of in Isaiah 40.3.  The voice, the vessel of speech, cries from the wilderness.  John himself was in the wilderness and foretold of the coming of the kingdom of God and called people to restore their souls to a pure state.  Only one in the wilderness could have insight into the time when the kingdom would come; God Himself was always away in the wilderness.

John did another thing while in the wilderness: he ate locusts.  The locusts were clean per Leviticus 11.22, so they could be eaten as food.  Yet the locust has a deeper significance.  In Revelation 9.3-11 we find that there is an army of locusts that torment men.  Their king is the angel of the bottomless pit, known as "The Destroyer" (the meaning of Abaddon and Apollyon), who is none other than the devil himself.  His army is the swarm of locusts that destroy men and make them wish for death, but John consumes them as food.

John was sent into the wilderness.  A noble spirit coming in the spirit of Elijah would deserve more than a life of eating bugs and wearing tattered clothes, but the Lord needed a voice to cry from the wilderness and a soul suitable to both hear and carry the message.  The Lord also needed someone to baptize, cleanse, and bring to salvation those who were lost in the wilderness - as well as those who went there in search of God.

The third instance of the wilderness we can examine is Christ Himself.  In the first chapter of Mark, Christ is baptized by John.  "And immediately the Spirit driveth Him into the wilderness." (Mark 1.12) If Christ, who was also named Immanuel, is in the wilderness, what are we to make of it?  Moses was driven forth as punishment and had to remain an additional 40 years with the children who were left in the wilderness as punishment.  If the wilderness is a penalty for some wrong-doing (Moses' murder, Israel's idolatry, whatever wrong John may have done) then what could Christ, who was free of sin, be penalized for?  There can be nothing, for the voice in verse 11 even states that God was "well pleased" with Christ.

If the wilderness was not a penalty, it must have been a mission.  All we see in Mark is that Christ was tempted of Satan for forty days.  In Luke and Matthew we find the dialogue between the two.  Satan tempts Christ, the two have a discussion about scripture, and then Christ banishes Satan before being tended to by angels.  The struggle with Satan and the revealing of the supernatural only takes place in the solitude of the wilderness.  Christ's mission was to drive Satan away, and the Spirit "drove" Christ to the wilderness to carry out this mission.

The separation of the wilderness makes communion with God possible; there are very few distractions and little intimate contact with others.  The quiet and solitude allows one to seek God.  For those who have been tested by the wilderness (as Moses) but sent into it regardless, they may be driven by the Spirit to do right or to struggle against evil.  It is apparent from scripture that the tools to battle evil are attained in the wilderness; Moses could only confront Pharaoh after conversing with God, John ate locusts while in the wilderness, and Christ confronts Satan in solitude before beginning his ministry among men.  It is also apparent that God must send someone; the well of the Midianites would be undefended and the sheep would die, those lost in the wilderness would not be guided to salvation, and devils would be free to tempt weaker passerbys.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: One can learn a lot by comparing Japanese reactions to the recent earthquake to western ones.

<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110314/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_earthquake_130">The Japanese government came out and said that the heavens were punishing them for being greedy</a>.  That was why the earthquake happened, and the general populace should take heed.  It seems that the Japanese don't mind the idea of an interventionist God, unlike Americans who <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/08/31/142742/-Fundies:-Katrina-is-Gods-punishment-on-abortionist%21%21%21">roundly condemned preachers</a> for saying that 9/11 or Katrina happened because God was displeased with our corruption.

Mind you, these are the same Japanese people who have refrained from looting, follow the commands of the government when it tells them to stay indoors for fear of radiation, and who have generally behaved contrary to westerners in similar circumstances.  That isn't to say that Japan isn't about as corrupt as any modern country can be - their government subsists on bribes, they abuse women and children, and they have an extremely <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/mrkurtzhedead/japan-earthquake-tsunami_n_834380_80406957.html">high abortion rate</a>.  Nobody is perfect, but Japan tries.

The west, however, has been unshaken by the fact that the earth can explode in such a massive, awesome way as to shorten the day and move coastlines.  Their focus is on what lies within human control: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/8392636/Japan-crisis-forces-rethink-of-the-nuclear-option.html">nuclear power</a>.

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany announced that there would be a three month moratorium on a standing plan to extend the lifespan of seventeen nuclear plants.  She also insists on closing seven nuclear facilities that were built before 1980.  The European Union has followed up by drafting a plan to test the safety of nuclear power plants in the twenty-seven member states.  China too, betraying their constant desire to become like the west, has stopped approving new nuclear facilities.  There are similar calls being made in the United States.

California residents are buying iodine tablets, a known treatment for radiation poisoning, and students near the state's coast are monitoring for radiation themselves.  Nobody in the state seems the least bit concerned that the entire rest of the Ring of Fire has had major quakes in the past year, the scale of which would level Californiam cities.  The issue at stake for them is the distant scare of a man-made problem.  The focus is purely on the human, while the orderly Japanese have warned that God is displeased with selfish humans.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>A Migrant Problem of Revolutionary Proportions</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: As usual, the friends of democracy were wrong and the oppressive tyrant was right.

This week, France and Italy had a dispute over "illegal migrants."  The western press is portraying this as an immigration problem.  The politicians involved are happy to oblige.

The French seek to curtail legal immigration in order to address the challenges of illegal migration.  <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/7354863.html">Mr. Claude Gueant lumped the two as sub-sets of the broader immigration category</a> both with the policy and with his reasoning behind it, saying that the French government needs to "fight against illegal migration and to regulate legal migration."  This came after a dispute with Italy, who when faced with waves of illegal migrants decided to ship them to France.  According to the report, Italy has arrested more than 25,000 illegal migrants since January.

The previous article hinted that these migrants left Tunisia to escape unrest and poor economic conditions.  Other articles have been even less generous.  <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE73I1RY20110419">Reuters reports</a> that most of the migrants are from "sub-Saharan Africa" but left from Libya.  The ones leaving Tunisia are simply "young men seeking to work in France" which naturally explains why they left North Africa for Italy instead of France.  This article makes a loose connection between the unrest and the migration issues.  However, it implies that the waves Europe is seeing now are identical to the waves it would have seen if North African governments didn't fence people in.

<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-16/-biblical-exodus-from-africa-feeds-anti-immigrant-rhetoric.html">The problem here, in the eyes of the press, is Europe</a>.  Governments aren't stepping up to accept migrants.  They simply want a better life, to work, and so forth.  Marine Le Pen is the problem.

We may tentatively say that the problem is Europe.  European governments sponsor revolutions to promote "democracy" or something.  As these revolutions spin out of control, they tell people fleeing the destruction that they have to go home.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/world/africa/05tunisia.html">They've now gone as far as to start patrolling the coast to prevent migrants from leaving their homes.</a>

Should western countries accept migrants who potentially harbor anti-western sentiments?  Yes.  <a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/gaddafi-if-libya-is-threatened-thousands-of-immigrants-will-invade-europe-from-libya/">It's not like they weren't told this would happen last month.</a>]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: People in the west may find their gas prises creeping a little higher as unrest reaches their friends in Saudi Arabia.

Conservative groups are quick to point out the radical Muslim connections at play in the recent Middle Eastern uprisings.  It is true that the Muslim Brotherhood and others are attempting to seize power in the wake of popular uprisings, but far more sinister elements are at work.

<a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/sharqiyah220411.html">Saudi Arabian protesters are calling for an end to Wahhabism</a>, a very strict Islamic sect.  What's interesting about this is that they are united with the Islamic groups in opposing the United States and Israel, as well as their current government, but their aims are radically different.  When examining these uprisings, we must never forget that popular uprisings are popular only because it's easy for people to oppose the status quo but difficult for them to agree on an alternative.

This, at its heart, is the trap most people fall into when they support revolutionary events.  No matter your position - in a western country writing for a newspaper, or on the streets of a foreign capital, everybody is preoccupied with abolishing the existing government but nobody is entirely sure what to do once it's gone.

Many unite to become one in a revolution.  Once the government is gone, the real struggle commences.  Two factors determine the outcome.

First, strategy.  The truth is, the Marxists are better at strategy than most other groups.  <a href="http://angryarab.blogspot.com/2011/04/syria-and-aljazeera.html">We may suggest this because they are already concerned about the outcome</a>.

Second, enchantment.  Here, the Marxists fall short.  Their secularized conception of history doesn't have as powerful a hold on a religious society.  This was the problem when the Soviet Union attempted to influence

Once the remaining authority falls away in these places, the real struggle will be between the Islamists and the communists.  This author predicts that the communists may yet win; they simply aren't being acknowledged by the western public.  In the end, western intervention on the side of the opposition will likely turn against the Islamists because self interest is a hallmark, not a contradicting value, of liberal intervention.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The Swarm takes flight close to home.

If you live in Monmouth County New Jersey, be advised that Mr. Pat Noble, a long-time socialist activist, <a href="http://votenoble.com/about/">is running for a seat on the Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>.  His basic platform is that democratic socialism is better than the elitist status quo.

If you live in Detroit, <a href="http://www.socialistwebzine.org/2011/04/socialist-elected-in-detroit.html">Mr. Matt Erard was among five candidates elected </a>to a three year term on Detroit's Downtown District Council on April 5.  He formally took office on May 1.  "Rather than continuing to subordinate the political will of the people of Detroit to the economic will of our city’s Wall Street- and Grosse Pointe Shores-dwelling overlords, the working class population of Detroit now stands exceptionally primed to lead the way in demonstrating what it means to bring the economy under the political will and democratic control of the people," Erard said. Expect chaos.

If you live in Charlottesville, Virginia, <a href="http://votebrandoncollins.wordpress.com/issues/">Mr. Brandon Collins is running for city council</a>.  He also is an advocate of democratic socialism.  He wants to fundamentally transform the world in order to eliminate all forms of oppression.

These people are everywhere.  Until either the status quo has intelligent defenders (unlikely since intelligent people are the first to spot its rampant corruption) or the reactionary right comes up with alternatives, the socialists will continue to take over because they provide answers to the moral questions people care about.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Rapture Won&#039;t Happen on May 21, 2011</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In times of uncertainty, people flock to those who claim answers or special insight.  It's only natural to crave a firm response to the world's corruption.  This author is concerned that if those responses prove to be false, people will become even more disenchanted.

A California minister by the name of Mr. Harold Camping has used the large audience of his Family Radio company to convince a lot of people that Jesus Christ will return on May 21, 2011.  Once here, he will rapture the believers while the sinful and corrupt world suffers for five months until the final judgment on October 21.  This is inaccurate.  There will be no rapture.  Christ will not return on May 21.  Judgment will not take place on October 21.  When Mr. Camping is proven wrong, people will react one of two ways.  Either they will go back to the Word for answers, or they will say that Christianity is wrong because, as the billboard down the street says, "The Bible guarantees" that Christ is returning this month.

It is impossible for man alone to destroy a faith, even a false one.  All we can hope to do is to provide a consistent argument <i>before</i> the fact.  In other words, we can provide answers to Mr. Camping's teaching before May 21.  After May 21, there will no doubt be several explanations and justifications but it will be the critics before who hold the most credibility.

Thus far, responses to Mr. Camping have been weak.  Critics simply point out that "we can't know" per the Book of Matthew, where Christ says that no man will no the day or hour, and that the day will come as a thief in the night.  Mr. Camping has answered both of these arguments, but his critics just float them out as if these two claims can be enough to convince his followers.  Our endeavor must be greater.  We must strive to dismantle Mr. Camping's entire system of thought so that no stone is left standing atop another.

<b>1. World History</b>

If we should pick a place to begin, it should be the beginning.  This is true in <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/Religion">religion</a> as it is in anything else.

Mr. Camping asserts that the earth is approximately 13,000 years old.  He calculates this by going to the Second Book of Peter 3.8 where it reads that one day is as a thousand years with the Lord.  He then adds up the days of creation in Genesis and the time that has passed since then to argue his 13,000 years.

This 13,000 year old story assumes that creation and the rebellion of Satan has all come to pass within this short amount of time.  His account ignores what the Bible says about the actual <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/religion/how-old-earth">age of the earth</a>.

First, in Genesis 1.2 it reads "And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." In verse one we read that the creation took place in the beginning, and then in verse two we see that the earth was without form and void.  However, the word "was" here is not "was" in the original Hebrew.  The Hebrew language lacks a verb for "to be"; this is why in several other places the various verb forms for "to be" are in italics because the translators have added them for ease of reading.  Here in this first part of Genesis, the word "was" is not in italics, so it must be an actual Hebrew word.  It is <i>hayah</i> in Hebrew, which means "became."  This is especially crucial because the following phrase "without form and void" is <i>tohu va bohu</i> in Hebrew.  <i>Tohu</i> is a confused wilderness, a desert.  <i>Bohu</i> is a ruin or mess.  We know for a fact that God is not the maker of confusion and that one cannot ruin something that does not exist, so we must understand that an event took place to cause the earth to become <i>tohu va bohu</i>.

This event is mentioned several times in the New Testament.  Christ speaks very plainly about how He knew some "before the foundation of the world" and that these some would be selected to carry out his plan.  This word "foundation" is interesting in Greek.  It is <i>katabole</i> which means "deposition" or "founding."  It is directly related to the word <i>kataballo</i> which means "to throw down."  This is a political phrase in the Bible; it means the founding of a new order and the casting down of an old.  This is a very different word than the Greek <i>themelios</i> which relates specifically to a substruction of a building.  We see this meaning very plainly in verses like Luke 6.48 where Christ speaks of construction.

The deposition that this speaks of was discussed in Ezekiel 28.  Here we read about a prediction against the King of Tyrus, who was "in Eden" and who was set as a guard over the throne of God but was cast out because of his pride.  The widely interpreted, and correct, view is that this King of Tyrus in Eden was Satan himself.

Mr. Camping does not look beyond the timeframe of this age.  He sees only the struggle between Satan and God within this particular period of time; he assumes that it began then and will end then.  We are faced with a God who chooses His elect, who does not inform His elect, and who raptures them regardless of their spiritual orientation while believers who attempt to reach Christ are condemned because salvation is entirely in God's court.  He chooses.  We must wait and see if we make the cut.  As we will discuss in the next section, this leaves many things unanswered.

<b>2. Neo-Calvinism</b>

Mr. Camping adopts a fairly traditional line, which ironically explains his insistence that the truth is just now being revealed in full and that he has access to that truth.

The Calvinist line of thought argues that there is a small body of elect Christians is saved while the large majority of people are condemned.  We cannot know who is saved and who is condemned because God is mysterious and chooses the elect based on His unknowable plan.  Anyone who asserts a doctrine of free will is arrogantly entering God's domain and attempting a do-it-yourself program of salvation.

Furthermore, the churches are all corrupt.  In John Calvin's time, this argument applied to the Catholic Church.  In Mr. Camping's time, it applies to every church.  The world is corrupt.  The popes are liars.  The only escape from this is a God who reveals directly to the elect and only the elect.  Neither Calvin nor Mr. Camping can know if they themselves are even saved; they spend their lives crying unto God and hoping He will save them.

The Calvinist interpretation fails to take several things into account.  First, it ignores the full version of world history.  In doing so, it focuses on the here and now only.  When interpreting the Bible by looking only to this particular time, you will misunderstand crucial Biblical concepts.  As such, you are faced with verses that tell you that God chooses the elect, only the elect overcome the Antichrist, the elect are chosen before they're ever born, and so forth.  It is easy for Calvin and Mr. Camping to say that only the elect are saved in light of these verses.  It is easy for them to say that because they do not acknowledge what happened before we were made flesh and why what happened before might determine why some were set aside from others, and why St. Paul could write in Romans 8 that some were predestined and already justified (judged) from before.

Mr. Camping's Calvinism is dangerous.  Not only does it negate the parts of the Bible, such as John 3.16, where salvation is offered freely to anyone who desires it, but it undermines any possibility of a community of believers.  The unsustainability of the Calvinist Puritans in New England was an example of this.  An invisible body of elect Christians who do not choose to be saved or go to hell is not a belief most people can stomach for very long.  People begin craving outward signs of salvation; they begin looking for ways to confirm their final destination.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140439218/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorusorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0140439218">Max Weber authored an illuminating work on the subject</a> and how every day Calvinists coped with their eternal uncertainty by looking for confirmation in economic success.  The great moral purity that's commanded by Calvin's teaching immediately leads to a demand for a visible body of chosen Christians.  This demand undermines the Christian community because any deviation from the moral purity (which every person will inevitably have) will be seen as a sign that the person is condemned.  There's a constant "clamping down" on people's behavior, a constant ostracization of those who don't fit in, and a constant incentive to find some kind of confirmation of salvation.  This leads, paradoxically for a faith claiming to be salvation via grace, into a faith calling for salvation through works.  Somehow if we plead enough with God, make enough money, abstain from enough alcohol, or work hard enough we will be saved.

The idea of weeding out the impure and the continuous moral improvement of society is the exact theological influence that fuels the secular progressive narrative we find in Marxism and liberalism.  There is a constant progress, a constant striving to be saved, and due to the limitations of the dominant narratives of world history, there is an assumption that salvation will take place within this world.  For all of the Christian critiques of utopian idealism, this new doctrine of Mr. Camping's has incredible utopian implications.

<b>3. Rapture</b>

Mr. Camping's utopian idealism is nowhere more apparent than his profession of the rapture doctrine.  In its various forms, the rapture doctrine argues that when Christ returns, he will lift the saved into heaven while condemning those left behind.  There are a few verses quoted to support this theory.

First, there is the account given by Christ in Matthew 24.  There will be two people in the field, one shall be taken and the other left; there shall be two women grinding grain and one shall be taken and the other left.  There are many people who stand in front of congregations today proudly saying, <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1099782/pg1#17547618">"I want to be the first taken."</a>  These people do not read verses 38 and 39 that likens these people to those in the days of Noah who were eating, drinking, and taking in marriage until the flood came and took them away.  This new flood is not a flood of water but a flood of lies, otherwise both in the field and at the grindstone would be taken with it.  Those who are taken are swept away by the falsehood.

Second, there are the words of St. Paul in First Thessalonians 4.17 where he writes, "Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."  This word "air" means breath and it can often mean spirit or wind, and is used in similar contexts as the Hebrew word ruach which we find in Genesis 1.2.  This interpretation makes sense in light of the subject of the Thessalonian passage in verses 13 and 14 which is rising like Christ.  Just as Christ was given eternal life in the spirit, so are we.  Those that have risen first are the dead who believed on Christ while those alive at the end of days will be transformed as mentioned in I Corinthians 15.52.

I Corinthians 15.52 is also cited by many who believe that the faithful are raptured before the Antichrist appears.  They say that "last" does not mean the last but rather the sixth, as in the sixth trump of the Book of Revelation.  They argue that this takes place just as Antichrist appears, so that believers are raptured with Christ before the tribulation.  However this too is inaccurate for the Greek "last" is eschatos which means the farthest or final trump.  We see here that there is no period of darkness as predicted by Mr. Camping and other "pre-tribulation" rapture believers.  There is no gap between believers being lifted out and the end of human history.

In Mark 13, Jesus gives a very straight forward account of what will happen when the Word is fulfilled.  The faithful will be delivered up to councils and religious places and be made to give a testimony for Christ's sake, and this testimony will be given in that hour by the Holy Spirit.  There is no mention of any early escape for the faithful.

Further, St. Paul makes it clear that the believers will not be gathered to Christ until the son of perdition rises up above God and has himself worshipped as God in the temple.  Only then will God begin to prepare the world for Judgment.  It is not, as Mr. Camping has said, that the believers will be lifted first and then God will shake up the earth for Judgment five months later.  The faithful must be here to testify against the son of perdition during the five month period.

Finally, God's prophet Ezekiel is also clear on the matter.  Ezekiel 13.20 has God telling the false prophets that he is against those that plot against the children to convince them to fly.

The rapture doctrine is dangerous because it leaves believers unprepared for the final struggle against Satan.  It is dangerous because in its popular form, it tells people that Christ will return before Satan, which prepares them to follow the first figure who appears as God.  In a word, it places them into a position to follow the son of perdition who will be worshipped as God.

This doctrine, in the interim, is also dangerous because it gives Christians an excuse to check out.  They do not have to concern themselves with the world, its corruption, or what's going on around them.  They do not have to work in the field, they can sit back and wait to be lifted out.

<b>4. May 21 - October 21</b>

These developments are complex and numerous.  From a misunderstanding of the chronological order of events to a misinterpretation of election to a utopian abandonment of responsibility and finally to a man with a radio show who predicts that all will be fulfilled just a few days from now.  It is time for us to tackle this last obstacle - his prediction of a real date.

<a href="http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/outreach/tracts/may21/">The EBibleFellowship</a> states that we can know.  Critics of course point to Matthew 24.36 where Christ states, "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."  Naturally Mr. Camping and his congregation have heard this argument and acknowledge it.  The EBibleFellowship argues in response that Daniel 12.4 informs us that God sealed knowledge from Daniel because that knowledge was supposed to be revealed at the end.

This is true, some knowledge is withheld until the end.  However, this argument is circular.  Mr. Camping tells us that he knows because it's the end and the Spirit has revealed the knowledge.  He knows it's the end because he knows the knowledge and he only knows the knowledge because it's the end.

In Revelation 1.10 we have one of the few explicit accounts of someone living at the end of days.  Here we see St. John transported to the Lord's Day, which is that final hour where all is fulfilled.  What do we see about knowledge?

First, we see that when the seven seals are unsealed for John, he was offered an open invitation to view only the first four.  "Come and see" is said only before the first four seals are read.  If we assume that the Word of God is the divine Word, then we must assume there are no accidents or oversights.  Why then would there be an open invitation to "Come and see" only four, while the last three were simply recorded?  This implies that some knowledge is opened to the public while other knowledge is more private.  Only those with eyes to see and ears to hear go to see these seals.

Further, in Revelation 10.4, St. John was witness to the voice of the seven thunders but was commanded to seal it up.  So even here we see that some knowledge is made available to the believers at the end, but that they are not in a position to share it openly.  This means that those privy to the seven thunders can't write them down for others and certainly can't go on a radio show to talk about them.  The EBibleFellowship is correct to say that God will not hide his design from those to be delivered before the son of perdition, but these people may not discuss it openly lest unreliable souls fall into the trap of serving the son of perdition while knowing the full truth.  Those that know the full truth are liable to be delivered up to this false one and would commit an unpardonable sin if they were to refuse the Holy Spirit at that time.  It is thus for their safety that these things remain veiled for those who do not have eyes to see.

EBibleFellowship is correct to say that the connection of the scripture that says Christ will come as a thief in the night with the rapture is false because thieves come to destroy.  When the false one comes and the whole world follows after him, and when the events come to pass as they are written the elect will know that Christ will return shortly and it will not be a surprise.  God has indeed forewarned His people; it's called the Bible and one must read it.

<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/01/BA8V1AV589.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news=">Mr. Camping has done some math</a> to come up with May 21 as the date of Christ's return.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614270473/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorusorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=1614270473">While numbers are used in spiritually significant ways in the Bible</a>, we should be cautious about anyone who would use them to unveil something that, if true, would not be suitable to be unveiled to everyone.  Furthermore, Mr. Camping's mathematics are backwards.  He is attempting to take the spiritual numbers and use them to come up with something concrete (a date).

In each place in the Bible where numerics are used to teach, the number belongs first to the concrete (the number of David's stones or the measurements of the temple in the last four chapters of Ezekiel for example) and then the spiritual is found beneath the physical.  The physical, while true, is used to convey a deeper truth, which is why in Proverbs 25.11 it says, "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver."  When God chooses specific words and numbers for some outward teaching, this outward portion is the silver which is a valuable teaching in itself but underneath that is the gold which is more precious.  We may say that if any word is fitly spoken, it must be the Word of God.

EBibleFellowship states "God's people know [...] that these dates are true and trustworthy only because this information comes right out of the Bible.  Many people are going to trust their churches or their pastors who will assuredly say that they do not have to worry about a date. But none of these things are trustworthy.  The truth is that the only trustworthy thing in the world is the Bible.  This is why as we get ever closer to this date of May 21 in 2011, the big question for each person is, 'Do you trust the Bible or do you trust something else?'"

People waiting for Christ to appear on the 21st will not be persuaded by this author's position that the spiritual numeric should not be used to calculate an actual date, especially when no person is supposed to know the date.  They will continue to believe that Mr. Camping's calculations are biblical until he is proven wrong next weekend.  After that point, Christians must ask themselves, do you trust the Bible or do you trust something else?  People need to do their own research and not believe that someone's math is Biblical without something more than a guarantee from a person.

This author's fear is that people will still believe that the Bible guarantees that May 21 is the day for Christ's return and His failure to appear must mean that the Bible is wrong.  All that will mean is that their teacher was wrong, and there will be a lot of heartbreak on the 21st - especially and even with Mr. Camping.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Adolf Eichmann and Mens Rea</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: This author owes some explanation for his prolonged absence.  It is not, as some might suppose, that I was <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/religion/rapture-wont-happen-may-21-2011">raptured away</a> and then returned to his previous state once that particular article was discovered.  Instead a series of personal matters have been taking priority.

Through the course of these matters, there has been little time for writing but some time for reading.  After being acquainted with some of Hannah Arendt's shorter essays, it seemed that the time had come for a closer look at some of her more in depth works.

First on this list was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143039881/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143039881">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a>, which recounts the famous <i>Adolf Eichmann trial</i>, the trial of the man who Israel accused of being the mastermind behind the Holocaust.  Eichmann had been an SS officer under the Nazi regime and was the bureaucrat who headed up the government's official study of the Jewish question.  Originally, Eichmann had been tasked with finding "territorial" or "political" solutions to the "problem" of the Jews.  These consisted of mainly semi-forced to forced emmigration from Germany and deportation to countries of origin.  In some instances, Eichmann helped smuggle Jews into other countries illegally.

Arendt's work was controversial in two regards.

First, she blamed Jewish leaders for supporting the Nazis.  Basically, Eichmann and others would assemble Jewish leaders into special councils and then task these councils with designating who would be shipped off and who wouldn't, so long as certain quotas were met.  Arendt takes issue with the leaders who cooperated, even while knowing that those they selected would likely be gassed.  She argues that without internal cooperation from the Jewish leaders, far fewer people would have been killed because the Nazis would have lacked the resources to find people. The point Arendt is trying to make with her book on the Adolf Eichmann trial is that people who are far removed from a situation are culpable in the outcome.

Second, she rejected the claim made in Adolf Eichmann's trial that he was a mastermind.  Her claim is that Eichmann was more or less an idiot, not a genius.  She believes that he wasn't much of an anti-Semite, never physically killed anyone, and hated the sight of blood.  Regardless, it was beyond a doubt that he knowingly organized train shipments of people destined to die.  He knew exactly where they were going and what would happen when they got there.  Eichmann was a man who was far removed from the actual killing and was placed in isolation of the real events.  He was purposely situated so that he would think about everything else except the final outcome.

The Adolf Eichmann trial remains a controversy for much the same reason that current judicial proceedings are, in many regards, disjointed from reality.  The legal apparatus that exists in the world today was birthed by previous legal codes that existed in a time when the criminal was very much tied to the crime.  Put another way, someone convicted of murder in Roman times would generally have had to take a tool and personally used it to kill another.  Now, with the development of new forms of technology, someone can push a button, organize a train schedule, or close down a factory in another country and potentially kill thousands or even millions of people.  The old legal system always carried with it an element of criminal intent (mens rea).  It is extremely telling then that Arendt would point out that nobody was keen on extraditing Eichmann to Germany for a trial because the whole thing may have been thrown out for lack of intent.  Did Eichmann really mean to kill people, or was he simply doing a job that didn't actually involve a decision on who would live or die - those decisions were made by Jewish leaders who drew up the list, SS guards who performed shootings, or phsyicians who determined who was fit for work in the camps and who was not.  The Jerusalem court was faced with the inexplicable challenge of trying to convict a man of murder who never physically killed anyone, made a direct decision to kill, who didn't feel anything much about the people his work impacted, and who never would have opted to kill if the decision had been left solely up to him.

In short, the Jerusalem court had to convict on an intent that did not exist.  The real issue, which has never been addressed, was what the impact of jurisprudence's loss of mens rea actually has on our society.  The Eichmann trial gave precedent to governments in two regards - it allowed them to throw out the element of intent and it allowed them to break the law (kidnapping Eichmann from Argentina and putting him on trial in a country that didn't even exist at the time his crime was done) when prosecuting someone.  All of this was, and remains, an acceptable practice when pursuing the absolute, unbounded evil people in our midst.  But if the unbounded evil people are (as the psychologists who examined Eichmann said) perfectly normal people who simply get trapped in situations they don't understand, then this means the prosecutors (if they really believed that Eichmann was the mastermind of the Holocaust) are people who don't understand, then the whole situation is insanely tragic.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>One More Reason Not to Be a Republican</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/culture/arts/one-more-reason-not-be-republican</link>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There is a dark rumor that John Lennon was a closet Republican late in life.  We can be sure he would vehemently deny this were he alive; after all, being called a Republican is a terrible thing.

After perusing <a href="http://americanvision.org/4776/john-lennon-republican-theist-anti-evolutionist/">this article</a> out of curiosity, this author was struck not so much by John Lennon's secret Republicanism but Mr. Demar's secret Socialism.

First, Mr. Demar, albeit sarcastically, agrees with the atheistic opposition to dogma.  This is a regular occurrance with those who attempt to oppose socialism - first they recognize the socialistic argument, then they prove that the socialists are hypocrites, and finally they attempt to show that this hypocrisy means that the argument ignores a certain critical truth.  Yet Mr. Demar and so many others skip that final step and become hypocrites themselves.  The traditional Right is very much in favor of dogma, if by dogma we mean the accepted dictionary definition of a system of principles or tenets of a church, or something laid down by a church.  Any Catholic will find themselves accepting a great deal of dogma from the Church; any Protestant will find themselves accepting the tenets of the Bible (or more usually their particular church) as a dogma.  Since the writings of John Stuart Mill, dogma has been a swear word for a blind faith in something, which can only be rectified by a reasoned examination through human intellect.  This naturally creates a condition of a dogmatic belief in human reason.  The point here is not that John Stuart Mill, the socialists, and Mr. Demar are hypocrites, but that dogma is unavoidable.  We will always accept systems of tenets from authorities; the real questions are which systems do we believe, what makes that particular system more legitimate than the others?

Second, Mr. Demar takes John Lennon's alleged late-life "religion" as a genuine spiritual sentiment.  Now we certainly are in no position to judge another person's heart; we can only decide what constitutes a spiritual sentiment in the abstract.  To believe (not necessarily to say, since what one says is not always what one believes) that there is some mystical "higher power" that orders the universe but to 1) Not figure out what it is, 2) Not try to find out what it expects from you, if anything and 3) Not act on its dogma essentially deprives it of any relevance.  If a person does not do anything with the glimpse of knowledge that they have, that knowledge is not good for much.

Mr. Demar accepts this proclamation of wishy-washy mysticism as "theism", which is essentially agnosticism.  The Bible directs us to the passage about the Athenians' worship of the "Unknown God" and how this is an incomplete faith.

Third, Mr. Demar takes all of this - John Lennon's mysticism, his half-hearted rejection of the evolution from monkeys (though fish are apparently still on the table) and his alleged secret conversion as a genuine, material change.  He says that Lennon "grew up" and that atheism and socialism are dead ends, their followers will have to do the same.  His crowning achievement in this argument is Lennon's estate.  John Lennon had money.  He had millions, but professed to want to abolish all money.  His social position, the implication stands, contributed to his change of heart.  His "early flirtation with the theory of socialism was naive."  Why?  Because he lived well and had money; this eventually colored his outlook.  In other words, John Lennon's conversion was done for purely materialistic reasons.  This was Karl Marx's argument all those years ago: your outlook is determined by your class.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Invisible Committee&#039;s Coming Insurrection</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: "It's useless to <i>wait </i>-- for a breakthrough, for the revolution, the nuclear apocalypse or a social movement. To go on waiting is madness. The catastrophe is not coming, it is here. We are already situated <i>within</i> the collapse of a civilization. It is within this reality that we must choose sides."

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584350806/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1584350806"><i>The Coming Insurrection</i></a>is a book allegedly written by that Tarnac 9, a group of French anarchists who were arrested in 2008 for plotting to blow up a railroad line.  The book discusses the impending collapse of capitalist culture.  According to the Invisible Committee, the author(s), civilization is already in the midst of a collapse and activists need to choose sides in the struggle.

The Invisible Committee takes the reader on a journey of exploration of the seven circles of alienation.  These are self, social relations, work, the economy, urban life, the environment, and civilization itself.  Through it, they attempt to demonstrate the ultimate dehumanization that we undergo by participating in the current society.  In true Marxist garb, the state as an agent of capitalistic goals, oppresses us by extracting value from our labor forcibly.


Once this alienation is exposed, the Invisible Committee tells us that the entire capitalist edifice is weak; it is vulnerable to collapse.  This is why the activist must form underground networks to gather strength outside of the mainstream in order to strike at critical points.  Moments of chaos present themselves as opportunities to strike at the heart of the oppressive system.  They use the analogy of an appartment building being used as an urban fortress to fight the police.  On the outside, the appartment building appears like every other building in the metropolis, but on the inside the tenants have drilled holes in the walls to form new passages of escape during revolutionary struggles.



The argument in <i>The Coming Insurrection</i> is that a small, persistent revolt against the strata of society will collapse the entire thing, bringing the freedom of the masses.



Why does this matter to us?  Some have alleged that the Right's insistence on the insurrection's importance as well as the status quo powers' (i.e. the French police) prosecution and attack of the authors are nothing more than exaggerations.  We are, these people say, merely finding a scapegoat for the shortcomings of capitalistic society.  Our discussion of the book's arguments are neither exaggerations nor scapegoatery.  We are forced to confront and face the insurrectionary left because they seriously mean us harm.  The Invisble Committee may be correct - society may indeed already be collapsing.  Each person must choose a side; the activist on the left will choose to join the anarchists in their struggle against authority while those on the Right will choose to find new ways to undo and stop the revolutionary terror.



If the so-called <i>Invisible Committee</i> is correct, if society is the crisis and its collapse is inevitable - if, put another way, the age of modernity is over - we on the Right must choose sides.  This does not mean to merely side with the status quo, for there is no safety there and there is no support (they have attempted to eradicate us for hundreds of years).  We may simply acknowledge that the collapse is upon us, the time to discover alternatives has come, and that our current persecution is nearing an end.  What happens next is up to us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Rioters are a problem, but the real tragedy in Europe will come when there are no windows left to smash.

<a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/aug2011/euro-a13.shtml">The World Socialist Website rightly calls our attention to the record levels of unemployment in Europe.</a> One in four young people across Europe finds themselves without a job. Prior to 2008, this rate was signficantly lower at only 15%.  The statistic is indicative of unemployment for people between the ages of 14 and 24 throughout the 27 states in the European Union. However, this is merely an average.

In Great Britain, youth unemployment stands at about 20% and is rising fairly quickly. The government and the media were both taken aback during the recent riots by young people in that country. In Spain, the social-democrats have found their crowning glory in a horrendous 46% unemployment rate for this demographic. Germany, long considered the industrial war-horse of Europe, has the lowest youth unemployment rate at just 9.1%.

The socialists contend that this poses a risk for a revolutionary uprising. We would agree, but would argue against the positive nature of such an uprising.

These young people have little to lose in an insurrection. The current system has failed to provide them with property, ownership, social stability, religious creed, or any sense of responsibility. They have, as of now, no loyalty to it and plenty of free time. This spells a particular tragedy for Europe; not only is a large, young population becoming agitated (which may well lead to social unrest) but their bad economic and spiritual policies have jeopardized their most precious resource - their children. Having one in four or one in two young people out of work and separated from the productive centers of society is a huge and almost unforgivable waste of human potential.

While pundits are likely to criticize rioters, and while we may all agree that rioting is counter-productive to whatever (if any) aims rioters have, we can hardly blame them for their anger. It is absolutely depressing to watch a society crumble.

Our prayers must be with the people of Europe who may lose their children and with ourselves so that we may avoid a similar catastrophe. The truly frightening prospect, however, is that we may soon find ourselves in a situation where there's nothing left for rioters to break.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Against Seasteading and Competitive Government</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There has been <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/silicon-valley-billionaire-funding-creation-artificial-libertarian-islands-140840896.html">recent buzz in the news</a> about a group of libertarians who seek to build autonomous island communities. Being in the know, this author was exposed to the concept in 2009 and rejected it outright for a number of reasons.

The concept is simple.  Build an island or a floating platform out at sea, set up your own community with your own rules, and live. The blog "<a href="http://athousandnations.com/">A Thousand Nations</a>" has helped popularize this concept by calling for a "Cambrian explosion of government." The idea, invented by libertarians who no doubt are sick of the status quo and felt it imprudent to build their compounds on land, reeks of libertarian odor. The goal is to have a competition in government - make multiple types and naturally the most desirable will succeed. In other words, governments should have to compete in the same way a corporation does.

<b>My introduction to seasteading</b>

This author was introduced to the concept of seasteads and autonomous islands in 2009 and had a gut reaction to reject it outright. Something about it didn't seem quite right. It could be that the traditional exit-via-secluded-compound idea has led to disaster. Land compounds get taxed just as much as other communities, and you're still beholden to all their laws. A sea community, though more aesthetically pleasing, seems just as likely to end in disaster. The USG is a jealous god. If any lesson should be learned since 1914 it should be this: any government that competes with orthodox democracy is not welcome and will be crushed.  The USG has proven its resolve, despite risks of bankruptcy and universal ire, to stamp out any competing system. Deploying a few destroyers to dispatch a pesky revolting seastead or a few marines to storm an isolated, poorly defended beach head is never out of the question.  The USG may claim to stand for freedom and justice, but they've still held on to Guam and Puerto Rico all these years.

But that isn't the main problem with promoting competitive government. Let us assume that a community or group of communities can build an island and live on it successfully.  On what basis are they doing this? What belief do they have about the nature of government, human nature, and our motives? The answer is tragically, the same basis on which all governmental decisions are currently based. The foundational assumption is economic - that competition inherently leads to good things. No analysis is done to see if the economic influence on politics is good, if competing governmental systems ever compete peacefully, or if different governmental types buy into the metaphysical, economic assumptions that the libertarians do.

<b>The metaphysical problem</b>

In other words, this author proposes that autonomous island communities are a sham because they are not autonomous. They are all infected with the same intellectual disease that has plagued western government for 500 years. As such, they are all the same. Government and politics are not about allocating resources or setting up incentives for human action, they're about the carrying out of fundamental spiritual beliefs about the nature of the world.  When Europeans first set up polities in the Western Hemisphere, they did so to carry out a metaphysical mission. The puritanical notion of building a shining city on a hill that would exist as a true biblical commonwealth composed of God's elect was not just a bunch of words for them; it meant something, and that goal was what drove them to establish a new society.

The Puritans carried with them certain views, one of which was that communities either stood for God or they stood for Satan. Most readers (probably) think this is an outdated and strange way to conceive of a community, but there's plenty of precedent for human communities viewing themselves as the exclusive bearers of truth. The USG has thought it for years, the Soviet Union used to think it when it was around, the Shia communities in the Middle East think it, and there are plenty more through history, including the libertarians.

Now, there are going to be many libertarians that object.  They do not claim a universal truth, they say. But they do.

First, the claim that human beings make decisions based off of a cost vs. benefit, pain vs. pleasure calculus is a claim about human nature and the truth. Libertarians such as Dr. Mises and even Patri Friedman use this as the implicit basis for their arguments.  <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/06/patri-friedman/beyond-folk-activism/">Patri says</a>,

"In the modern world, however, bad policies are the result of human action, not human design. To change them we must understand how they emerge from human interaction, and then alter the web of incentives that drives behavior. Attempts to directly influence people or ideas without changing incentives, such as the U.S. Libertarian Party, the Ron Paul campaign, and academic research, are thus useless for achieving real-world liberty."

Did you catch it? Patri is making an assumption about policy.  First, he makes an assumption that the modern world is different than a pre-modern or post-modern one (an assumption that is metaphysical, based on certain beliefs about history and its meaning).  Then he says that action, not design is the cause of bad policy, and the solution is to understand how they emerge from action and change the incentives. What Patri is calling for sounds innocent enough, but it's really a call for an economic analysis into policy in order to understand how we can change it.  Perhaps Patri is right and this is what's needed.  Perhaps he's wrong.  For this argument, however, it doesn't matter.  He's made a metaphysical claim.  It shades his approach to politics and what counts as political, non-political, good, and bad.  He's also made a claim about the ends that politics works for ("real-world liberty").  The quoted statement is, in itself, a political argument and is the pre-requisite for his notion of competitive governments.

Why? Because of the second truth that libertarianism is claiming for us - competition is good. This is life and death for all forms of liberalism.  This drives the belief in the marketplace of ideas, the competition between companies, and the new proposed competition between governments.  The argument is that a peaceful discussion and debate will defeat falsehood and reveal the truth. The true argument will come out on top. The best company will make more money. The best government will acquire more citizens and wealth.  Far from being a novel concept, these autonomous island communities are a bland extension of the old argument.  The libertarian will fail to see, as we all have at some point, that the USG and its accepted world co-inhabitants already have plenty of economic analysis in their policy making.  One simply has to pick up any random public policy book and see discussions about cost vs. benefit, pain vs. pleasure, changing incentives, and expanding competition.  It is, sadly, a system of decision making that created the current mess.  Absent any insight as to how this economic approach led to the mess we have now, there is no reason to believe that the decay of these seasteads (all governments decay with time) will lead to anything but a similar vein of corrupt government - bankrupt, run-down, welfare-ships. Imagine Detroit on water. No longer urban decay, it's marine decay, and you heard the term here first.

So let's compare puritanical metaphysics (we use the Puritans because they did what these libertarians are hoping to do now - leave the mother country and start a new polity on new principles elsewhere, in city-state form) with libertarian metaphysics.  Puritan decisions are not made on a pain pleasure calculus.  Though Mises and other "modern" utilitarians have attempted to argue that costs and benefits are subjective, their attempts to fit everything in a rational frame is laughable.  As Nietzsche argued, the concept of love destroys utilitarianism; arguably there is sometimes more pain than pleasure in love and we nevertheless say it is better to have loved and lost then to have never loved. Further, it misunderstands <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/Religion">religion</a>. For the Puritans, the abstinence from earthly pleasure is a cornerstone of the faith.  The faith encourages believers to do contrary to what they want. Mises hints at this contradiction in Human Action where he compares such religious people to plants, saying that human action doesn't apply to them because they are closer to plants than people.  Puritans made decisions based on its compliance with scripture.  As such, they further rejected the second metaphysical claim libertarians propose - competition won't reveal truth, but error because any idea that competes with truth is aligned with lies.  The puritanical argument is much in line with the counterrevolutionaries after the French Revolution, such as Donoso Cortes who said that the Bible made it clear that discussion was frowned upon - Christ ordered Satan to get behind Him during the tempting in the wilderness, and with that the discussion was over.

Non-liberal government is naturally excluded from this autonomous island project.  Sure, the libertarian will argue that the Puritans among us can start their own seastead. But they can't and won't.  The minute an exclusive community is established, there will be conflict.  Either the Puritans will attempt to fight the agents of Satan (in the 1600's this meant going after the indigenous population) or the liberals will go after the agents of intolerance (which in our time means anyone who resembles a Puritan). In corporate competition, acquisitions are made with money; in political competition, acquisitions are made with soldiers.  To counter with a claim that the seasteads won't do this exposes the truth: only good liberals will become seasteads, because they either don't take their metaphysics seriously enough to defend them or there won't be anyone around to defend against.  Every libertarian seastead/island supporter should ask themselves: if the community next to me decided to stone homosexuals, would I really say to myself "What's good for them is not necessarily what's good for me" ?

The final metaphysical problem we encounter is that of legitimacy.  Prior to 1793, governments were almost universally held to be legitimate when the leaders were considered honorable.  Leaders were deemed honorable through birth, their perceived appointment by God (divine right of kings), actions on the battlefield, and their general character. Attached to honorable people was usually wealth and, though obscene, in most instances this was accepted by a population that was extremely poor because the wealthy person had honor and served a societally significant function (usually as protector of the wider population).  The notion was true across borders, meaning that the Emperor in China as well as the King of England were both seen as legitimate by their populations for much the same reason.  As a result of the existing paradigm of what was legitimate and not, governments took on particular forms.  Most were monarchies, which rested on the honor of one family.  Others, such as Venice, were republics, which rested on the honor of a group of nobles who would often make room for members of the lower class to hold particular office.

In the 1790's, with the culmination of philosophy and general corruption (the honorable were less than respectable), the societal condition was no longer tolerated and legitimacy was lost. Kings and queens were as good as dead, and in many instances they found themselves to be dead within a few years.  Others, such as in Britain, were neutered.  The new legitimacy was that of the people.  Governments had to be democratic and that was that.

In 1945, after years of struggling with Nazi Germany, the allied powers assembled together and found that the whole self-determination concept sometimes led to bad results. Sometimes Hitlers showed up and were supported by the wider population.  Leaving democratic states to do whatever they wanted in their own national borders was no longer an option.  Thus legitimacy was revised to say that countries had to be liberal and not just democratic, and when there was a conflict between the two (as there often was and is), the liberal side would trump the democratic.

The point here is that any seastead or autonomous community would only be allowed to exist if it were liberal.  A truly illiberal community, absent any formidable defense, would be eliminated from the scene.  It would be deemed illegitimate by the outside forces and police action would be taken.  The wider populations of Europe and the United States wouldn't mind much since they believe that the only true freedom that exists is a freedom under a liberal framework, and western countries have a long tradition of liberating and re-educating the poor dumb savages who don't see the light of liberalism.  What's worse for these poor dumb, sea-bound savages now, however, is that they will be persecuted with greater enthusiasm than indigenous people who never saw the light of liberalism and had to be introduced; these sea-bound savages are pure heretics who were once members of the church and left to practice witchcraft.  The USG is a jealous god.

Whether we were to assume that the other autonomous communities in this grand competition of governments would stamp out governments that truly competed with the status quo, or that the USG would stamp the competitors or everyone out, it is apparent that this island fantasy is a dead end.

<b>The solution</b>

What is to be done?  There are three options.

First, reform current ideas of legitimacy.  Sounds easy, right?  If you change what counts as legitimate government, you change how government runs.  Of course, even if you want to build an island somewhere, you'll need to change ideas of legitimacy - both so you can avoid becoming Them and so that They don't come kill you.

Second, go somewhere on the periphery and set up a counter-government.  The ocean is not the periphery; if anything, the powers that be have an easier time reaching people on the open seas than they do in the heart of Africa.  Grab some money, some weapons, learn the local language, and see if you can carve out a small area in a place the UN has a hard time managing.  The people there likely have little to lose and you stand a better chance of survival than you do in a row boat.

Third, wait for collapse.  All systems of legitimacy decay and fade away at some point.  Just sit it out, wait for the fires to die down, and spend your time figuring out what you'll do when Rome is gone.  You may want to learn Mandarin and stock up on dry goods; you never know what will happen.

				<title>On September 17, America Will Swarm</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The Swarm is coming to our shores on September 17. We know this because the revolutionaries have said that they will occupy Wall Street on that date and that they will operate as a swarm.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You can read about the upcoming swarm <a href="http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_63583.shtml">here</a> or by reading the latest tweets on the <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/search/%23occupywallstreet">#occupywallstreet</a> hashtag. Revolutionaries will continue to use disruptive means to attack the existing order.  The lessons for the Right are twofold.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

First, the Right must understand that the current order is extremely fragile.  Democracies die through bankruptcies and, while many on the Right are not friendly to democracy, it would be foolish to stand by or support efforts at creating chaos.  If revolution is a force of evil, then we should expect that only the most evil people will be able to win in the ensuing struggle.  Revolutions must be opposed and stopped; the Right must always attempt to use tactics that aren't evil.  Restorus was started on the belief that bringing members of the Right together to discuss and build a positive program would help curb the revolutionary impulse that exists currently.  Once the energy and hype die down, the average person will be left confused and looking for answers.  They won't find answers from the media, politicians, or most of their churches.  We can at least start providing those answers, and the Right needs to begin by doing more to show people that "occupying Wall Street" won't solve their problems.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Second, the current order probably won't stand.  When we say "order" we talk about what counts as politically and spiritually legitimate.  As this author hinted in his <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/against-seasteading-and-competitive-government">recent article on seasteading</a>, the current system of legitimacy is corrupt.  If the only argument that exists to defend it is that it's "the worst system beside all the others" we should simply be motivated to find something - anything - that is marginally better.  Currently, authority is considered legitimate if it's liberal.  It does not necessarily need to be democratic (this was the lesson of WWII when popular government used the miracle of modern technology to systematically kill millions of innocent people), it just needs to support liberal ideas.  Those are the same ideas the Right is attempting to fight, but it will fail unless we first identify a new source of legitimacy and second find the most effective way at persuading people to adopt it.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/from-jesus-socialism-to-capitalistic-christianity/2011/08/12/gIQAziaQBJ_blog.html">Gregory </a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/from-jesus-socialism-to-capitalistic-christianity/2011/08/12/gIQAziaQBJ_blog.html">Paul</a> has joined a long line of people who criticize conservative Christians for being against socialism. He's argued that Jesus and Christianity are self evidently socialistic and that any support of capitalism will contradict Biblical teachings.

Jay W. Richards at the Washington Post has<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/should-christians-be-socialists/2011/08/15/gIQAXlO0GJ_blog.html"> responded</a> to Mr. Paul by saying that there really aren't that many Christian supporters of Ayn Rand and that Mr. Paul's arguments are based on misleading interpretations of Scripture. This misleading interpretation stems from some overlooked verses and the fact that the state is nowhere to be seen in this Christian socialism Mr. Paul describes.

Unfortunately, Mr. Paul and Mr. Richards both miss the mark completely.

First, both men share a particular assumption about Christianity that leads them both to error. Both Richards and Paul assume that the Biblical teachings they're reading are concerned primarily about the physical world. Most discourse in our time that argues against socialism centers on the role of the state (which colors Mr. Richards' argument that Rome is not enforcing socialism so therefore it must not exist). Those who defend the assumed right wing position do so from a vantage point of comparing state intervention to non state intervention. This materialistic assumption drives Mr. Paul to make his strange Protestant ethic argument – that some Protestants got together and imagined that God must be happy with their Protestantism so he was blessing them through economic growth. For both Richards and Paul, God and the followers of God are incredibly materialistic. The faithful in Richards' world automatically become capitalists because the Roman government wasn't redistributing wealth. The god of Mr. Paul's world is naturally socialist because the “Christian economics” talked about in the Bible discuss how people weren't needy.

They miss the mark in that the faith is hardly about the material at all, but the spiritual, which our age has banned from all serious discussion. Mr. Paul stumbles on the general lack of discussion about economics by accident when he notes that “the only” mention of Christian economics in the Bible is this set of verses about people not being needy and how only the Christian community shared with each other. The materialism of both authors is rather striking when you notice that Mr. Richards fails to address how the conflict with socialism is one of faiths and that Mr. Paul regurgitates a twisted version of Max Weber's argument (Weber argued that Protestantism and capitalism influenced each other because the doctrine of predestination meant that Calvinists could never be sure if they were saved, so they began to seek out signs of their salvation in the world. Weber was very clear that we could never be sure which triggered which, if there was a trigger, just that they influenced each other and that the long term trend was a removal of the spiritual from the physical – at which point we would quit caring about God and salvation and just pay attention to the money).

This confusion leads, second, to Mr. Paul's psuedo-Weberianism. He falls into Weber's trap and thinks only in terms of the material.

Third, it leads Mr. Richards to make the stock responses to socialism that every capitalist has ever made. It's about government intervention, taxation, etc. He could have handled this a lot better by pointing out the real source of the conflict. Every genuinely socialist theorist has been an atheist. (What's fascinating is that most genuinely capitalist theorists have also been atheists.) Proudhon called on revolutionaries to worship Satan because he was the first to rebel against established authority. Marx proclaimed that all communism begins with atheism and all communism was an atheism. Saul Alinsky, in our own time, dedicated one of his books to Lucifer. All one must do to demonstrate the utter incompatibility of socialism and Christianity is to quote any socialist theorist on the topic of religion. Remember, religion, as they tell us, is just a product of capitalism and when we do away with capitalism we'll do away with faith too. We just have to believe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There's too much at stake for us to continue the current jobs rhetoric.


We all sound like a bunch of old Soviets with our talk of jobs. Indeed, as Oleg Kalugin mentions in his biographical work “Spymaster” (he was a KGB general), as the Soviet Union grew closer to collapse, the political insistence on making sure Soviet citizens were working to the best of their abilities, putting more Soviets to work, and making sure people did their jobs became almost deafening. The leadership insisted that work could fix the country's problems, and their rhetoric served to mask a deeper structural flaw.


It would be foolish to say that the American system is collapsing. Certainly many more steps are needed before we encounter true revolutionary insurrection, hyperinflation, or any of the other specters normally associated with collapse. However, we must admit that much is at stake in the current crisis.


First, we are breeding a generation of discontents. In modern societies, the youth have always held a certain dynamic potential that ideologies have been forced to acknowledge in one way or another. Machiavelli, like most modern thinkers after him, sought to harness the lack of rootedness young people have in order to promote new orders. The counter-revolutionaries have sought to check the dangerous nature of young people by placing them in institutions that instill a sense of ownership in society. Our young people lack that ownership. It's doubtful that they have much loyalty to a system that has educated them for careers that don't exist and then turns to them to foot the bill for corrupt policies. Should we continue to <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21528614">waste their potential</a>, we will suffer.


Second, the middle class, which ostensibly has the most to lose in a period of change, is losing most of what it has. Home prices are collapsing, the job market is fluid and requires frequent relocation if anyone hopes to maintain employment for very long, and inflation is eroding their savings, which has always been the source of their stability and their ability to live comfortably.


We are, in a word, situated on the brink of a very explosive situation. The youth are even more rootless than they normally are; they lack all role models and corrective institutions. The middle class are losing their connection and stability to the current order. We need leadership to prevent disorder.


But what leadership do we have? We turn to those in “authority” for some explanation. Everyone's answer is unanimous: if we just put Americans to work, everything will be fine.


The Democratic Party says that jobs are the answer. President Obama has given us several “jobs speeches” and plenty of “jobs plans” that have resulted in, as the Republicans will point out, no jobs. He promises us investment in green technology and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/07/us-obama-infrastructure-idUSTRE78667P20110907">infrastructure repair</a>, two ideas that are absolutely ludicrous. John Rockefeller didn't need a government grant to develop alternatives to kerosene. And repairing our roads to nowhere won't fix the government's problems. Both ideas are a joke: we need Uncle Sam's guidance to figure out which energy source is best (while detracting resources from other industries and creating more inflation and debt in the process) and we need to spend several years repairing roads. The Romans could build roads from Italy to Greece in just a few months; it takes us years to make corrections to existing infrastructure. We call this making work for Americans...


The Republican Party response is almost worse. <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/08/22/301637/romney-attacks-obama-for-releasing-jobs-plan-too-late-on-same-day-romney-is/">Mitt </a><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/08/22/301637/romney-attacks-obama-for-releasing-jobs-plan-too-late-on-same-day-romney-is/">Romney criticized the president for being “too late” with his jobs plan, and then came out later to announce his job plan. </a>Michele Bachmann <a href="http://www.breitbart.tv/bachmann-on-joint-session-speech-president-going-to-have-to-change-water-into-wine/">asked President Obama</a> to turn water into wine because the President of the United States is somehow out of line to ask Congress to gather their lazy selves in front of him on a particular evening. Nobody seems quite sure if jobs come from deregulation or protectionism (everyone conveniently forgets that a tariff is a tax, which I thought the Republican Party was against). Everyone claims that the government is bad at trying to fix the economy, but then Rick Perry hopes to take credit for “creating jobs” in Texas. Some now, are getting angry about the situation. Yes, we see some anger here – not at the ineptitude and utter stupidity of the debate taking place, but at the unemployed.


The argument goes that unemployment insurance is the source of the crisis. People are lazy, so when they receive a check, they stop looking for work. <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20110904-u.s.-losing-patience-with-long-term-unemployed-.ece">Some have gone so far as to suggest that the jobs are there, people just need to stop being lazy and go look for them.</a>


This author was, until last week, part of the “long-term unemployed” statistic (meaning that he held no actual work for six months or more). He had to go on unemployment insurance, and justified it because it beat starving and he had paid taxes while employed to fund the program. The program itself is a nightmare. You are supposed to receive it for up to one year and in the state of California, you can apply for an extension if you start to run out. Most employers contract with <a href="http://www.talx.com/Solutions/Compliance/UnemploymentTax/">unemployment claims agencies</a> to contest the workers' abilities to participate in the program. After his first check, this author received a notification informing him of his former employer's decision to appeal. The appeal process may result in all money collected after receiving the first notice having to be paid back and the candidate won't receive a hearing date for 12 weeks. The whole program is not preferable to an actual job, even one that pays less than the insurance. For some politician to accuse those collecting of “leeching” off the system is personally offensive; this author can document applications to several hundred unique positions over the past year. Granted some might leech, but some have always leeched. For a mass majority of people who found themselves unable to secure a job, the insurance benefits were all they could get.


Yet still we maintain that jobs aren't the answer. While they're certainly very important, they won't fix the problems we face.


First, we need a moral correction. The truth remains, a vast majority of people took out home loans that they couldn't pay off because they assumed that houses, unlike every other good in the economy, would never experience a downturn in price. The banks, of course, aided people and had no problem helping them lie about their means since a loose monetary policy combined with the promise of a government bailout made lending completely safe. The government responded in kind by bailing these faulty loans out and continuing the smoke and mirrors show of printing money and creating artificial growth in people's income. In a word, corrupt people in government helped corrupt banks guarantee faulty loans for corrupt lenders, and when this fell apart, the corrupt government responded by bribing people with money essentially taken from the poorest classes, who didn't have the means to even lie to the banks. (Inflation, as Hayek teaches us, is a triangle. Those who receive the money first can buy goods in the economy at pre-inflation prices. As the money trickles through, prices raise so that those further away from the stimulus/bribe have to pay more without receiving more.)


Second, we need an economic correction. Policies shouldn't be about jobs, because it's misleading to talk in terms of employment. The official employment numbers overlook those whose benefits have expired and those who have simply given up looking out of desperation. The government will never know how many people are actually unemployed, and even if they could they would likely lie to you about the number (it would be very unpopular to be honest about it). But even if we were to assume that the insight about the true number existed, the government could put them all to work overnight. Send everyone a shovel, promise them a paycheck, and have them start digging holes. Very easy, and the unemployment number goes away just like that. Yet that's not economically beneficial, nor is it personally beneficial to many of those out of work – while companies are reluctant to hire unemployed candidates, they're also reluctant to hire former government employees because people who work for the government are thought to be inefficient and sub-par to normal people. The focus, instead, should be on production. This is something no politician can interfere with or take credit for. Any misguided stimulus policy will always curb more production than it creates. Production is a true measure of economic well-being because where there's production, there is a drop in price (as more is produced), a higher standard of living, and efficient employment – someone has to make all the new stuff.


If we ignore the hard issues: that we're a corrupt and degenerate nation that operates under faulty assumptions about how the world works, we will have to answer for our mistakes. It is time to repent for false errors and find real solutions.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The press didn't pick up on the Day of Rage nonsense until after it fizzled. We gave you <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/september-17-america-will-swarm">a heads up</a> last month.

For some time, Restorus.org has been tracking what we term “the swarm”. Our argument has been that the revolutionaries act as a decentralized swarm instead of within a centralized program. This is why it's futile to try to identify any leader or central director; there simply isn't one. All that exists is a common spirit, which is the spirit of destruction that the locust carries with it.

The risk for these swarms is that they really do lack central direction. Their strength is simultaneously their weakness, and when it came to the recent Wall Street swarm, their lack of direction led to their downfall.

Using a mix of traditional American rhetoric, which no one will report on (many of the protesters wanted a second American Revolution and chose September 17 because that was the day the Constitution was signed, they wanted to do away with “crony capitalism” just as Sarah Palin wants to, etc.), and anarchist messages, the group never had a clear idea why they were gathering. In fact, the Wall Street demonstrations were designed to get people together so they could decide what they wanted.

A mob of people disgruntled about “the system” does not a revolution make. A mob of people that can't even agree to behave like a mob is worse than a revolution, it's a pitiful failure. The Right should take comfort in knowing that the insurrection's tweet is larger than its bite – sad, considering the character limit on tweets.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Article Five of the United States Constitution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Did the Founding Fathers ever fully think through Article Five of the US Constitution?

<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kalimkassam">@kalimkassam</a>, poking libertarians and tea partiers a little, suggested that the US Constitution has historically proven to be a blueprint for unlimited government.  The argument has been suggested in dark hallways far from the Beltway, but it does need to be considered.  Whatever genius the Founding Fathers may have had in attempting their Republic, their system birthed what we have now.  And by the standards of those who yearn for the old days of the Republic, what we have now is terrible.  Yet no one will address the cracks and faults in that original foundation that allowed us to turn into a bunch of chimpanzees in less than 300 years.

Restorus is an exception.  Just as President Nixon, a staunch anti-Communist, was the only politician who could credibly negotiate with China, the radical Right is the only group capable of opening this conversation.  After all, only liberals and those with liberal tendencies (i.e. those who part their hair on the left, oppose cervical cancer, or didn't clap when Rick Perry championed the express death row program Texas has) can be accused of treasonous behavior.

When <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kalimkassam">@kalimkassam</a> asked his question, another user, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/CJFontenot1/status/115598645008662529">@CJFontenot1 replied</a> and said "True, but majority doesn't want unlimited gov. Constitution forbids tyranny &amp; govt overthrow.  This author asked where in the Constitution tyranny and overthrow were prohibited, at which point <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/CJFontenot1/status/115832653567107072">the conversation turned treasonous</a> - perhaps we were wrong and no one is safe having this conversation. It is too late now, the point has been made: the Constitution opens the door to its repeal.
Article Five of the US Constitution reads:
"The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate."
So the only conditions laid out here are:

1. Changes can be made to the Constitution only once a certain number of people agree;

2. We can't change certain parts until after 1808;

3. States must have equal votes in the Senate.

The only implied limit is that there must be a Senate after the changes (so we can't do away with the Senate).  This limit doesn't mean much, of course.  The Convention could always amend Article Five to strike the section after the last semi-colon. As long as said change was ratified before any attempt to eliminate the Senate, it would be perfectly legal.  If not, then one must always remember that reducing state suffrage in the Senate to zero votes would also be allowed as long as all states were deprived of the vote at the same time. Two thirds of the Senate can legally vote to never vote again and there's nothing in this or any other document that could stop them.

Aside from these slight stipulations, if you have a party that makes up the two thirds majority in the House and Senate (assuming the latter hasn't gone home), you can amend your way to whatever you want.

There is one other bump in the road, and that's the treason clauses.  Granted, they too can be wiped away if the votes are there, but a careful reading of the Preamble makes this a moot point.  The Preamble states that the people ordain and establish the Constitution in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for common defense, promote general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.  If the Convention can lay a claim to both the people's will (which they could if they were voted in) and a program that allegedly creates a better condition for the above desired goals, they can't be accused of making war on the country (which the Preamble defines as the people through the word "ordain" which implies a sovereign decree) or of aiding its enemies since they'd presumably be aiding the people though expanded justice and so forth.  At least according to the law.

The purpose of such a mental exercise is to show that the document by itself can't defend itself. Some source of external legitimacy and order is needed, or else all you need is 356 people who don't want to play by the rules before the rules stop being enforced. Does that worry anyone else?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Supermajorities and Democracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The supermajority is a concept that defies all logic.

The supermajority is the practice of requiring more than 51% to enact a law, statute, or rule. In modern government, the supermajority requirement is generally reserved for very important decisions: constitutional changes, overturning an executive veto, etc. On face value, it seems to make sense – it shouldn't be easy to change really important things.

Yet there is no logic to the supermajority.

First, the supermajority destroys the legitimacy of the government that uses it. In modern government, the will of the people as expressed through democratic processes is said to be supreme. Even in a representative institution such as a congress, the members are elected through a popular vote and each member is supposed to make decisions based on the needs and interests of their constituency. Yet at what point during the voting process is the will of the people achieved? It certainly can't be disputed that a unanimous vote represents the will of the people; if everyone votes for something, literally everyone wants that something. Is 51% the will of the people? Presumably. Democracy rests on the assumption of a demos, or a unified people that have come together to agree on a certain form of political procedure and way of life. When a majority of that unity decides on something, that must be its will. In Hobbesian terms, if my stomach is hungry but my mind wants to continue writing this article and I write the article, my self has expressed its will if I continue writing. Since the body politic has been employed as a metaphor by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, who contributed greatly to our idea of the modern state, it stands to reason that this 51% is the expression of an actual will (Rousseau has a nuanced take on this, but his views haven't been adopted wholesale – different article for a different time). So democracy is fulfilled with this 51%.

To demand something more than 51% is to suggest that 51% is not really the will of the people. If the modern state constitutions are accurate when they say the people form the government, then 51% should be ample to make any change whatsoever. If a unanimous vote is required, then the assumption is that the people's will exists only when everyone is in agreement – thus nullifying the legitimacy of all laws passed with anything less than 100% of the vote. If a supermajority of two thirds or three fourths of the vote is required, then the entire system of voting is called into question. If I can pass a law with 51 people, but can pass larger laws with 67 people, the rule requiring 67 is only democratically legitimate if these extra votes are qualitatively different than the first 51. The fact is, any legislator or citizen can find themselves counted in the additional percentage, so it is only numerically different. And if voting only satisfies an arbitrary numerical requirement (why 67 and not 83?), it doesn't have much of a claim to justice. Yes, more people support an idea, but there's no justification as to why a larger number of supporters adds legitimacy to the idea. I have numbers and support, not necessarily truth – and a greater proximity to the truth has been the sole justification for liberalism's insistence on free speech and press. These things too, potentially, lose their legitimacy.

Once this legitimacy has failed, voting is just a matter of numbers and the state experiences factionalism. It's just a matter of groups forming alliances of numbers to seize political control of the state to pass what laws they wish through legal means. In other words, voting is no longer an expression of the will of a unified people but the will of disparate, self-interested groups. Democracy has ceded to pluralism.

Second, supermajorities strengthen tyranny instead of preventing it. If the justification for requiring a supermajority was to make important laws more difficult to change so that a strong group couldn't easily oppress a weaker one, then the supermajorities fail miserably. When 51% tyrannize 49%, it is much easier for the smaller group to defend itself. When 67% tyrannize 33%, the smaller group has a much more difficult time resisting tyranny. Equally, when 99% decide to persecute the 1%, the 1% has no chance of survival.

To say that oppression has been averted through the use of supermajorities is false; supermajorities only guarantee stronger forms of tyranny down the road. To say that decisions made by a supermajority hold more weight is also false; they erode the only source of legitimacy that the state has claim to.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Religion and John Locke&#039;s Letter Concerning Toleration</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Does John Locke's call for religious toleration display an immense intolerance toward religion?

The fact that anyone in our secular age would ask the question already reveals the answer the questioner has in mind: yes. A normal, modern reading of John Locke's <i>A Letter Concerning Toleration</i> would fill the typical person's heart with warmness and joy; an unfiltered, heretical reading leaves a person horrified at Locke's complete fumbling of theological issues, his arrogant disdain for serious belief, and his inability to follow an argument to its conclusion. If this is John Locke's religious toleration, we should be very concerned.

John Locke's <i>A Letter Concerning Toleration</i> forms the basis of the liberal (classical and modern) argument today: religion is a matter of personal opinion and should therefore be expressed only in the private sphere. In order to make this argument, we would contest that John Locke must relativize and trivialize religious ceremony to be “mere opinion” and silly in order to justify its exclusion from public life.

Locke, hardly the master of subtlety, starts his letter of intoleration with a broad attack on all serious religion. He writes, “I esteem that Toleration to be the chief Characteristical Mark of the True Church […] everyone is Orthodox to himself.” [23]

This is a double pronged attack. First, Locke has labeled all those who would disagree with his letter as being excluded from the Body of Christ (which makes up the True Church). He has second, informed us that orthodoxy stems from individual adherence to individual belief. It does not, as was asserted by churches at the time, come from the authority of priests, and it does not, as asserted by this author, stem from God. It comes from the individual.

Toleration for Locke means that the churches must stand down. He tells us that churches have no “Jurisdiction in Worldly matters”, which means simply that <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/Religion">religion</a> has no weight on what people actually do. Instead, we must find our own paths. [32] Locke says that “in this great variety of ways that men follow, it is still doubted which is the right one.” [36] He takes direct issue with Christ's proclamation that He is the Way; Locke does not seem quite sure which way is the Way, or at the least because those who do not follow Christ dispute His claim to be the Way, Locke doesn't feel comfortable in informing them of their error. The Way is either unknown, not the Way, or not worth being discussed. This begins John Locke's efforts at relativizing and trivializing Christian tradition.

Once he has completed his assault on the Way, John Locke's religious toleration attacks baptism and holy communion. First, he states that no one would ever get upset about how one washed an infant, but plenty of people get upset about how baptism is carried out when sprinkling water is an indifferent activity. Second, he says that no one would become angry over eating bread and drinking wine, but people take offense at allowing or disallowing others to take communion when eating and drinking are indifferent things. Locke claims that these have been relegated to “human discretion” precisely because they're indifferent.

Locke on religion is a Locke who has trivialized religious ceremony by relativizing everything that caused contention in his time. If he made baptism, communion, and critical scriptural differences to be matters of indifference, people would stop fighting about them and Locke could lay claim that his tolerance (read as: watered down, sanitized faith) would create “peace and security.” Locke and his secular followers miss a few critical points.

First, baptism, communion, and scripture aren't matters of indifference. To say that they don't matter is just as strong a statement about them as saying that they do. Second, any statement about religion's role in public affairs is both a religious and political statement. It is a statement about faith's power or lack of power in our lives and it's a statement about what counts and doesn't count in politics. Locke kids himself when he claims that decisions in one realm don't or shouldn't impact the other: being told you don't have a voice is one of the largest impacting decisions that can be made. Third, Locke's letter concerning religious toleration only attains their peace and security by stripping the value out of belief. We may agree that wars, deprivation of liberty, and so forth, in the name of religion are harmful and tragic, but we can also agree that what's worth living for is also worth dying for and taking that away is also positively tragic.

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The #OccupyWallStreet protesters have failed to come up with a unified message or purpose. Now they're taking their disunity to the rest of the country with the #OccupyTogether movement.

Glenn Beck will tell you they're just a bunch of Marxists. As we've pointed out and as this author has witnessed around the web, the American swarm is composed of more than just Marxists. Ron Paul supporters, tea partiers, populists, the Anonymous hacker group, and Marxists have all shown up at the same place to protest. What they're protesting isn't clear – some rail against the bankers, others against the government, others against the state of Georgia for killing Troy Davis, and more still treat the whole event as a party instead of a revolution.

We on the Right must take comfort in the complete ineptitude and stupidity of the movement. As the protesters hold their days of rage, we remain safe so long as they never figure out what to rage about. That's not to say that we support bankers, the government, or Georgia, we just disagree with the tactics – especially the tactic of aligning with Marxists for a “common cause.” Their cause is not our cause. Moldbug was correct to suggest that we can't out-devil the devil, so we should stick to methods that work for the Right.

The Wall Street protesters, either overcome with their energy or frustrated at their failure, have decided to occupy quite a few other places as well. Major cities will be occupied as part of the #OccupyTogether movement. To get a full list of protest locations, <a href="http://occupytogether.org/">click here</a>.

This author will, naturally, be abstaining from protesting. The mob, no matter how well-intentioned, is far too easily swayed by the voice of the few who shout “Crucify Him!”]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The 12th Imam: Muhammad al-Mahdi</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/religion/12th-imam-muhammad-al-mahdi</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Who and what is the 12th Imam?

With all the hype about the 12th Imam (mainly hype for the Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad), we decided to investigate. Here is your comprehensive guide to the 12th Imam.

<b>What's an Imam?</b>

In the religion of Islam, an Imam is a leader or prophet. According to the Shiites, only Allah can appoint an Imam. An Imam is the true political and spiritual leader of the Muslim world, and each serve as a sterling example for the rest of humanity. Imams are the prophet Muhammad's successors and, as such, are said to possess divine authority and insight.

An Imam is the direct descendent of the prophet and to date, there have been 11 Imams.

<b>Who is the 12th Imam?</b>

The 11th Imam, Hasan Al-Askari, had a son with the granddaughter of an Emperor in the 13th century. Some say that her name was Fatima, others Nargis Khatoon.  The son was named Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, but is called Muhammad al-Mahdi - Mahdi means "the Guided One" and Mahdi is said to have been in subterranean hiding since he was about five years old.  The Hadith prophesies that he will return shortly before Judgment Day. It's said he will appear after a three year period of tyranny, chaos, and disorder. After his return, he will rule over the world for seven years while bringing total peace.

In the literature of Sunan Ibn Majah, Mahdi and Jesus are one and the same. In Ahmadiyya Islam, the terms "Messiah" and "Mahdi" mean the same and apply to the same person.

<b>Why does the 12th Imam matter now?</b>

Ahmadinejad has openly called for Mahdi's return. While Half Sigma has received feedback from people that suggests Ahmadinejad doesn't really believe in this Mahdi stuff, HS has asked the obvious question: why spend so much time talking about it? Especially in front of the UN.

The media, as usual, either ignores the issue or gets it wrong.

Glenn Beck and others have gotten it wrong, sort of. They suggest that Ahmadinejad will create three years of chaos in order to spur Mahdi's return and that Mahdi is the Antichrist because he comes in with chaos and destruction.  The media figures who notice the rhetoric coming out of Iran get the story wrong when they say that Mahdi must be the Antichrist because of his destructive nature. We would suggest, on the contrary, that Mahdi may be the Antichrist because he brings peace. If Mahdi and Jesus are said to be the same, and St. Paul tells us that the Antichrist will sit in the seat of Moses pretending to be God, then we must assume that, if there is a Mahdi, this entity would be interested in appearing as peaceful and Christ-like as possible.

Our concern should be with the preceeding three years of darkness.

Outside of this sparse coverage, the media has ignored the issue. There are three possible explanations. First, the idea is too bizarre to them to explain it. Ahmadinejad is crazy or lying, and the idea of having to explain to a modern secular society that there's a fellow trying to develop atomic weapons so he can bring in three years of darkness before the apocalypse is uncomfortable. Second, the idea is not bizarre to them and is so common that it doesn't even deserve a mention. After all, most western ideologies see themselves as, one way or another, launching a revolution, a genocide, or a union strike that will create a period of unrest before a bright new future emerges. The idea of an impending "war to end all war" followed by a peaceful progressive future isn't that alien, even if it's dressed in Shiite garb.  Even Glenn Beck does it when he calls for the "third spiritual awakening" in America before we turn back to God and repent of our ways - his tri-part history of the Republic is creepily similar to the tri-part narrative of revolutionary movements; remember friends, they didn't call themselves "The Third Reich" for nothing.  Third, they're lazy and didn't bother paying attention to any of the speeches. The third is the least plausible possibilities, since there's at least one person on staff at a major news outlet somewhere who's assigned to watch Glenn Beck.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Troy Davis Execution</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/politics/troy-davis-execution</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In the rush to either save or kill Troy Davis, Troy Davis was sadly forgotten.

Troy Davis' funeral is scheduled for Sunday, so this, as opposed to the moments leading up to his execution, are more appropriate for discussing the sad fact that Troy Davis has been forgotten. One the one hand, anti-death penalty activists used the flaw in Troy Davis' case to hint at his innocence so that he might be spared. On the other hand, pro-death penalty supporters downplayed such doubts (for example, by suggesting that the “lack of physical evidence” was not a lack of physical evidence and just the lack of a mere search warrant) in order to justify the death penalty.

Neither side cared about Troy Davis or Officer MacPhail.

Those who oppose the death penalty cared about the points they could score with Troy Davis' dead body (or before, the risk of his dead body) – the fact that his body was black allowed them to score further points against Justice Clarence Thomas because they were then able to accuse him of being an Uncle Tom and not caring about black people. The disgusting signs of “We are all Troy Davis” show the real farce that their support of Davis has been; Troy Davis is dead, we are not. We are not Troy Davis and he is no longer one of us. Your t-shirts, rallies, and Facebook groups will not bridge the divide between the living and the dead and you will never, ever know what it's like for the state to kill you or a loved one until one of those two situations happen.

Those who support the death penalty must insist on Troy Davis' guilt and must use his dead body to counter-balance Officer MacPhail. MacPhail, likewise, does not matter. Articles refer to MacPhail as a cop and Davis as a cop killer. The lines are drawn rather abstractly so that each becomes an example of a general case instead of a specific one. Cops are good, noble, and protective of society. Cop killers not only commit crimes but they take aim at those who volunteer to be good, noble, etc. The case becomes one where the cop killer should be killed because no one should get less than death for being a cop killer. Who the cop is, who Troy Davis is, and whether Davis is actually guilty don't matter; the latter is assumed to be true and deserves attention only to the extent that it can fit Davis into the archetype of the cop killer.

This Sunday, let's pray for Troy Davis and Officer MacPhail. Everybody seems to have forgotten about them.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Vice President Joe Biden is one of the few politicians with either the guts or stupidity to tell the truth.

<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/biden-were-in-charge-of-the-economy/1?csp=34news">Biden admitted today</a> that the Obama administration is "in charge of the economy." In a series of comments where he repeated the claim several times, Biden said that while some blame the previous administration, they aren't in charge anymore and the Obama/Biden team is.

Biden is exactly right: with each new administration comes a new set of overlords.

He is wrong, however, to suggest that we should choose between the lesser of evils in the upcoming election. If the only thing the electoral system can offer us is shades of evil, then we deserve much more than a bad economy.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Bonald looks back on the end of history and concludes that it may well be the end.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://bonald.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/looking-back-on-the-end-of-history/">In this depressing piece</a>, Bonald asks us to consider if Francis Fukuyama was correct in his book The End of History. Fukuyama stated what everyone believed, that history is the story of a progressive development of capitalism and democracy. Now that such things are the norm, history, so the saying goes, has ended. Continued liberal advance, says Bonald, seems like a good bet.

&nbsp;

Bonald's right if two things don't happen.

&nbsp;

First, that Europeans and Americans decide that they can't live with the consequences. Familial destruction, rampant hedonism, etc. have all come to pass. If we find, as the conservative hypothesis states, that such things do destroy a society's ability to survive, then eventually these societies may cast off the bonds of liberalism.

&nbsp;

Second, and Bonald raises this as a possibility, scarcity of resources may put a damper on the eternal progress we're now supposed to experience.

&nbsp;

The second possibility is less likely; the climate science movement has already proven that liberalism can adapt to a world of scarcity. The first works only in a world where people wake up (unlikely) or where there's significant collapse.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: How do you turn blind rage into something useful?

<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kalimkassam">@kalimkassam</a> was kind enough to include me in a Twitter conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kyachtic">@kyachtic</a>, the Leader of the Libertarian Party in Canada, where the latter was asking how the #OccupyTogether movement could direct their rage toward something practical. Of course, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kalimkassam">@kalimkassam</a> asks if this would even be desirable. It would not; the last thing we need is for the mob to gain real power. Even acknowledging that the occupy groups aren't all a bunch of Marxists, history tells us that the Marxists are better at harnessing crowds for revolutionary/nefarious (they may as well be the same word) purposes that only an idiot would join their crowds.

Nevertheless, the #OccupyTogether groups are destined for failure. I say this because #OccupyWallStreet didn't have a goal or unified message from the outset. They weren't sure if they were fighting banks, the government, oil companies, Israel, the UN, or the State of Georgia. Then they blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge - the impact of such a move did irreperable damage to their movement. Instead of fighting for "the little guy" or "the worker" or "the American" they interrupted said workers' commutes home. They created undue stress, frustration, they kept parents from their children longer than the already too long their work day plus commute keep them appart. They probably even helped the big oil companies through all the gasoline that was wasted sitting on the bridge. I say that #OccupyTogether is a failed movement because it seeks to replicate that aimlessness and frustration across the country.

My response to <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kalimkassam">@kalimkassam</a>'s question was, I feel, something that would have made #OccupyWallStreet successful if they would have done it. Since none of the occupiers likely read Restorus, and if they did they'd quickly distrust any advice coming from these quarters, I feel safe presenting my ideas openly.

The first thing the protestors should have done was to decide on an emotion. I read tweets that made the whole protest seem like a giant block party. The Day of Rage didn't have a lot of rage.

Second, and related to the first, is purpose. Why are you there, what do you want? Some vague promise of a second American Revolution is enough to get the police to show up, but not enough to form a political movement. Further, in that instance, the police have thought out their purpose (to prevent violent insurrection) much more than the protestor has (to revolt, or something). Politics is chess; you generally lose to the person who has planned out more moves than you. Figure out what you stand for. The first indicator that this would be an aimless movement was that the protestors openly claimed they wanted to create a Tahrir Square moment in the United States. I still don't know what everyone wanted in Tahrir Square and I doubt the protestors do either. Everyone wants "freedom" and "democracy" but I doubt many in either group can answer what those words mean to them.

Third, find an enemy and defeat them. While I disagree with the protestors' chosen tactic (gather in large numbers and yell at things), they have apparently already come up with an approach they feel comfortable with. That approach needs to be directed toward someone. I said on Twitter that #EndTheFed was stupid; it ought to be #FireBernanke.* Naturally firing Ben Bernanke is a prerequisite to ending the Federal Reserve, so it fits with a broader goal. While this site and others spend considerable time examining the impersonal nature of our bureaucratic governments, we must always recognize that bureaucracies exist to crush and destroy politics. They are an end to political action.** Finding and defeating an enemy, as Carl Schmitt teaches us, is the essence of politics. Therefore an attempt to fight the bureaucracy as "the enemy" is justified, but misguided. This will only result in the formation of your own bureaucracy (and this an end to politics and your struggle) or defeat as you are unsure where your energy should be focused. Think of Ron Paul and other libertarians; they oppose "The State" and they hope to fight "The State" and "The Statists." Where should they begin? EPA, FDA, CIA, FBI, DOE, FCC, FTC, DOT, BOP, CBO, NYT, CNN, MSNBC, etc. All of these organizations have thousands of employees who depend on the bureaucracy for food and other things. They are so massive and you are so small, and the minute you start fighting them all at once is the minute you start losing.

<a href="http://restorus.org/articles/Politics">Politics</a> is about people. Even if government has hidden behind the monstrosity that is the bureaucracy, any successful political struggle must be focused on people. The smaller the group, the better. If you can narrow it down to one or two, you're in business. Everyone has enemies who they work with; attacking the organization will only cause everyone to unite to defend against the outsiders who would threaten their pensions. Targetting just one insider and centering your energy there will dramatically increase your odds of success; firing one person is easier than dismantling an entire organization. The momentum you gain from the public victory will allow you to continue to advance on the long term goal. Tahrir Square, while lacking a real purpose, at least gained short term momentum and a public victory by getting Mubarak fired.


*<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kyachtic">@kyachtic</a> responded by saying that, in Canada, Bernanke isn't known much and, further, his firing isn't a prerequisite to ending the Fed. The first point is entirely true, and is the reason why this mass universal movement fad won't work. The oppressors in the United States are different from the oppressors in Canada. While a universal movement might agree on what characterizes an oppressor (if the movement is organized by intelligent people, such as was the case with international Communism), the actual targets of a protest will vary. The second point is technically true, but again with an intelligent organization, the arguments behind #FireBernanke can be translated into a larger #EndTheFed goal - especially if people in power go on record with agreeing to fire Bernanke for the same reasons you want to fire him.

**<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kyachtic">@kyachtic</a> responded (after most of this was written) by saying that 1) rage doesn't work, logic and reason do, and 2) politics is undesirable and should be avoided. Thus we have arrived at why I'm not a libertarian.

First, logic and reason (whatever those are or mean - the "reason" of today is not the "reason" of yesteryear) work only with a group of friends who agree on certain ground rules. I will continue to raise the question, what happens when people don't agree to play by the rules? Have you ever been so enraged that logic and reason stop being persuasive? If we consider that the Far Left operates based on a politics of rage (rage against Wall Street, the State, authority, God) and that the Far Right has a politics of fear (fear of societal, familial, religious collapse) we only have to imagine times in our own lives where rage and fear were more persuasive than any rational argument to see that rationality will always lose when confronted with the sheer power of irrationality. (There's more to be said, but perhaps in tomorrow's article.)

Second, as stated above, the desire to avoid politics led to the creation of the bureaucracy. The original literature justifying its growth (esp. Max Weber) in the mid 19th century calls for a group of public servants who were disinterested from the day to day political strife. We need "experts" who would apply "logic and reason" to public affairs so that the most optimal outcome would always happen. This plan failed, of course. But further, I would argue that politics is unavoidable. (When <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/JonathanE22">@</a><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/JonathanE22">J</a><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/JonathanE22">onathanE22</a> laments that humans cannot live in peace, he is entirely correct. We never will.) Even the attempt to end politics will and has met resistance from those who would preserve it. If politics is about the identification and struggle against enemies, we may say that politics gives people something to die for. Likewise, if we abolish the forces that give us something to die for, we might also abolish the forces that give us something to live for. What then are we "free" for?



Naturally, I'm grateful to <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kalimkassam">@kalimkassam</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kyachtic">@kyachtic</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/JonathanE22">@JonathanE22</a> for the interesting, intelligent, and motivating conversation. I hope that no one is too taken aback by my assaults on logic, reason, and all that is holy. All are welcome to respond/contribute on Restorus.org or elsewhere; I'll be sure to pay attention.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Marine Le Pen's surging popularity in France validates the Restorus hypothesis - in periods of instability, people turn to the Conservative Right for answers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Via <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/sdlenser">@sdlenser</a> on Twitter, the French Far Right is "benefiting" from the Euro crisis. As people become disillusioned with the Euro's ability to help France, people are turning to Marine Le Pen's National Front Party. Le Pen proposes a radical solution: abandon the Euro, withdraw from globalization, reindustrialize France, and knock the banks down to size. People are beginning to be attracted to this message since the old answers of globalization and free trade don't seem to be working and Le Pen has been pretty consistent in this message.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/marine-le-pens-crude-message">Earlier this year</a>, I derided Ms. Le Pen for being an outdated defender of a dying nation-state. This allegation still stands. Until the National Front recognizes that an economic answer will fall short because we are faced with a spiritual question, their message will remain poorly articulated. French voters are turning to Le Pen because the nation-state was perceived to be stable, unlike the world after the nation-state has lost its legitimacy. The National Front and their followers are grasping for alternatives to liberal legitimacy. Their turn to the nation-state will not work; it too was dangerously unstable and French society can't support it again. They are too fatigued and too weighed down with a plethora of self-interested parties that have seized and held on to public funds.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Le Pen's victories will be short-term if she does not further emphasize the religious aspect of her message - that part that The Economist chided as having "heavy Catholic overtones." She needs to embrace this and she needs to reignite real faith in France. Once the French public turns back toward a genuine spiritual order, they will find the solution to their crisis and their anxiety. The collapse of the Euro is the springboard to this restoration; what is built without God cannot stand. This is the lesson of the Euro and this is the lesson Marine Le Pen is poised to teach.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Where do rights come from?

Hardly a day goes by where I don't read a complaint against Rick Santorum, liberals, or the government about the origin of rights. Any time someone makes a statement that rights come from the government, an army of people line up to shout.

I have seen a few arguments in response to the claim that rights come from the government.

First, <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/glenn-beck-confirms-that-your-rights-come-from-god/">rights come from God</a>.  God grants rights, we use those rights, and government has no say in the rights. The main justification in America for this view is the Declaration of Independence which states "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." There are a few sentences that follow that, for our purposes, deserve to be included here:
"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."
Now within this, we see a few things. First that the Creator endows people with unalienable (cannot be given up) rights. These include the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Following this, we see that to secure these rights, we make governments. When the government fails to secure these three plus others (the others are unknown, we merely see that the three are "among" certain unalienable rights) that we also have the right to abolish or alter the government. So we have four rights clearly laid out: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, and the right to alter or abolish the government.

Others, we must assume, are enumerated in the Bible. <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/130601/our-god-given-rights-where-in-the-bible-does-god-give">The question of where is raised here</a>. There are some decent responses in the comments, but naturally this site must rely on arguments that go deeper than "Bro, it's common sense..."

Second, <a href="http://www.cusc.org/">rights come from the Constitution</a>. Is this seriously an answer to the claim that the government gives us rights? A simple reply that yes, in fact, they do give us our rights. The Constitution sets up the government of the United States, plus certain amendments that guarantee rights - free speech, free religion, free assembly, bearing arms, not being searched without cause or warrant, etc. Per Article 5 of the Constitution, all of this is, presumably, fair game in a constitutional convention. If we can make an amendment to ban alcohol, then to un-ban alcohol, we can likewise make an amendment to disallow free speech. There is no limit to what Congress can change. What the government guarantees, it can un-guarantee.

Third, <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-rights.htm">rights are a social construct</a>. This article is just silly. One, it's an insult to lump "conservatives" with "John Locke." Baboons have come up with more well-thought out arguments than Locke. The man and all his followers disparaged God and opened the door for rights "subject to change." Two, it's an insult to say that "philosophers" are concerned with is/ought problems. David Hume came up with the ridiculous idea that the state of the world ("is") couldn't be confused with the wished-for state of the world ("ought"). The argument is that morals and science never cross paths; they are separate domains. We say this is a ridiculous idea because science tells us that we get hungry and the minute we put food in our mouth, we have crossed the is/ought line by saying "I ought not to feel this way." We may assume that Hume and the author of the article died within a few days of writing this brilliant idea down. Three, the author is stupid. He or she claims that "no one seriously defends" the idea that God gives rights because God supposedly blessed monarchy, genocide, polygamy, parental killing of disrespectful children, etc. The author clearly does not read the same sites I read... And I dare say that genocide is an entirely modern concept - one that stems, in part, from the notion that rights are subject to change due to social consensus. The setting up of death camps and factories to do away with entire ethnic groups was a modern invention. Four, just because these mysterious, unnamed philosophers have disagreed with each other over where rights come from doesn't mean that there isn't an answer - it more likely means that philosophers (at least the ones that the writer of the article appears to be reading) are also idiots.

Defenders of "rights as a social construct" must come up with a better argument than the absence of a definitive answer.

So where do rights come from? From God, I would argue - if we'd bother to actually read what <i>HE</i> said about rights instead of what other people say He guarantees us. However, most rights are tied to the government. The right to a fair trial assumes a world where trials take place and where laws are enforced. Rights are social, not because they're constructed socially, but because they operate in a social world. Rights are political rights because they are rights within the <i>polis</i>; rights are civil rights because they are exercised within the <i>civis</i>.]]></content:encoded>

Mayor Linda Thompson (D.) was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/harrisburg-pennsylvanias-capital-files-for-bankruptcy/2011/10/12/gIQAeQ6HgL_story.html">opposed</a> to the measure and called it illegal. She said that the bankruptcy was an embarrassment and interferes with the city's ability to borrow funds for municipal projects.

Seriously? The reason to oppose bankruptcy is it puts a damper on your ability to rack up more debt? If this is the lesson that we learn from this, Harrisburg won't be the only government to file for bankruptcy.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Mesothelioma Claims Increase as Asbestos Settlements Are Curbed</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The competing sides in the mesothelioma settlement debate are getting it all wrong, and the cancer victims themselves will suffer for it.

Asbestos is a naturally occuring silicate mineral that has historically been exploited for its desirable physical properties. Asbestos first became popular in the late 19th century because it could absorb sound, resist fire, insulate from heat, and could withstand chemical and electrical damage. Asbestos has been mixed with cement and woven into fabric. The mineral itself occurs as a long, fibrous crystal.

Research has linked asbestos inhalation to an otherwise rare form of malignant lung cancer called mesothelioma. Since the linkage was paid, lawyers have spent enormous sums of money to find mesothelioma victims and help them win even larger amounts for asbestos settlements.

Cancer takes years to develop. In Korea, mesothelioma claims are expected to skyrocket in the coming decades as people who inhaled asbestos during their careers develop the disease. However, prior to the research into mesothelioma, firms didn't know that the disease would kill their workers. One could make the argument that they wouldn't care if they did know, but putting a toxic mineral in fiber and concrete and letting customers live and work in such buildings is bad for business - the minute you decide to rennovate your house, you find yourself exposed to a lethal carcinogen.

In such cases, the firms are punished for something they didn't know about. The Scottish Supreme Court recently ruled that mesothelioma claims would continue to be heard; insurers responded that they didn't have enough money to pay victims for damages. Asbestos settlements are likely to become smaller or disappear altogether for some victims. The gravely ill will likely not receive any compensation while those who are not as ill will collect what money there is until insurers run out.  Politicians and unions have responded in kind by demanding that victims "<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jqXmkQbztVLOJUsBLwl2M5SziVGA?docId=N0021331318376529943A">must</a>" be paid out.  Lawyers, as to be expected, continue to solicit mesothelioma claims on behalf of patients in order to win big settlements.

The real tragedy here is the people with the disease.  The firms don't care because they didn't know. The insurers would prefer people stop sueing because of the associated costs. Mesothelioma lawyers (granted, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-13/scottish-asbestos-law-may-curb-payouts-to-sufferers-herald-says.html">not all</a>) don't care because they only want big payouts, even if the very ill are cut out of the deals. The unions and politicians don't care because they just want to be seen as pro-worker. Interested parties have made this about the size and frequency of asbestos settlements - meanwhile, people die.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Should we fault Business Week for its over-emphasis on economics, or its readers?

Citing clashes between Coptic Christians and security forces in Cairo, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-11/egypt-violence-prompts-resignation-concerns-on-economic-growth.html">Business Week informs us</a> that the Egyptian finance minister resigned from his post. Approximately twenty five people were killed in the protests, signaling the era of peace promised the world by those who toppled Hosni Mubarak's “repressive and violent” government earlier this year.

The so-called Arab Spring has spelled bad news for Christians in the area. Previously reigned in factions now have room to move about and breathe. Any democracy in the region will be dominated by Muslims who form the majority. The rights of minority Christian groups in the country will be curbed sharply.

Business Week and, perhaps, the Egyptians worry about the economic impact of the unrest. To them, the flow of goods, not the flow of blood is paramount. So long as people are free to trade without being hindered, the occasional murder of a few Christians is unimportant.

We are faced with two stark facts.

First, the Western sponsored Arab Spring will fail. Western politicians and theorists continually get confused about the paradox that is liberal democracy. In a democracy, the majority rules. In a liberal government, all sides are free to participate in perpetual discussion that forms the policy-making process. These two ideas ultimately clash; it is impossible to allow all sides to participate in the discussion if one or more sides are fundamentally anti-liberal or anti-democratic. To give such factions free reign allows them to potentially overthrow the democracy. Thus, in order to survive, the democracy is forced to take illiberal measures to protect against internal and external threats. The West sponsored and hoped for a liberal democratic wave to sweep across the Middle East. They will likely get democracy, but their democracy will be a true democracy – one based on numbers and that isn't afraid to take action against the smaller groups.

Second, the mental and spiritual disorder of materialism has already gripped the Egyptians and has certainly gripped most in the West. The Finance Minister resigns because security forces killed Christian protesters – as if the fighting between Christians and Muslims in Egypt is about economics.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Amidst my conspiracy for world domination and right wing restoration, I sometimes play video games. Sometimes.

The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is, perhaps, the first 3D Zelda game. Made for the Nintendo 64, an ancient behemoth of a gaming system (it uses cartridges, gasp!), the storyline follows Link as he does what Link is wont to do. He must rescue Princess Zelda, defeat the evil Ganondorf, and save Hyrule from certain destruction. In the first half, Link is a child and must collect the three spiritual stones for the Princess, after which he must go to the Temple of Time to unleash the legendary Triforce so that Ganondorf may be defeated. But Link is fooled and Ganondorf takes the powers of the temple for himself while Link is trapped inside for seven years. After seven years, and in the second half of the game, Link must awaken seven sages who will unleash even greater mystical powers to seal away Ganondorf.

So aside from me reliving the past by playing the game once more, what can we learn about politics?
<ol start="1">
	<li>The forces of evil stand for chaos. Likewise, the forces of good stand for order. Ganondorf brings evil and disorder to Hyrule. The hero must combat the disorder, which manifests itself as disrupted prosperity, chaotic natural events, etc. Whether it's Goron Mountain losing its supply of food or Zora's Domain freezing over, chaos reigns supreme when evil takes over.</li>
	<li>The hero's task is to restore order. Link must restore order and when he defeats various manifestations of evil, things are restored to their previous state. There is no progressive ideology in Zelda; things are set to what they once were.</li>
	<li>Artistic and cultural development occur with the side of good, not evil. The culture from which Gandondorf emerges is built on thievery and deceit. That of Hyrule produces the magic and music that enables Link to fight evil. He Hyrulean culture builds tools that aid the hero in his attempts to restore order. As it is with the forces of the Right as they use the tools of traditional culture to fight the forces of disorder that threaten their lives.</li>

<a href="http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Gadhafi-dead---Did-Matthew-Perry-sitcom-predict-it--Video/8399594">You can read the full article here</a>. Matthew Perry in the one-season series "Second Chance" is standing in line for heavenly judgment right behind Muammar Gaddafi. Saturday Night Live also predicted that Jimmy Fallon would be a huge star in December of this year, odd since he will begin hosting SNL this December.

				<title>It Didn&#039;t Take Long for Liberalism to Fail in Libya</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: As Restorus.org has argued time and again, liberalism and democracy do not always go hand in hand. The developments in Libya are proving this true.

The transitional government in Libya has begun trying to formulate a new legal system based on Sharia law. Westerners responded with horror and disbelief that Libya, which is now formally a democracy (there will be a vote to determine the next steps), would take such an illiberal position.

Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, the former minister of justice under Gaddafi, has assured the international community that Libyans are moderate Muslims. We at Restorus are not convinced. We would argue, with good reason, that political moderation is a lie. The Libyans are either building a state that draws its legal legitimacy from the Koran, or they're building a state that draws it from liberal values. Neither is moderate; one is radically Muslim and the other is radically liberal. Legitimacy, whenever it appears, is never a moderate idea, but universally one of the most radical implications.

<a href="http://www.euronews.net/2011/10/25/libya-ponders-sharia-law/">This article</a> is almost painful to read; the poor writer is lamenting that "modern democratic freedom" (i.e. the only freedom that likely counts to the reader) may not bloom in Libya.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Lawrence Auster makes an excellent point about Iraq's democracy.

&nbsp;

Lawrence Auster at "View From The Right" <a href="http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/020832.html">asks us to consider</a> whether neoconservatives have been hypocritical about their criticism of Libya's recent declaration of Sharia Law. He points out that Iraq's 2005 constitution makes Sharia Law the basis of that country's democracy, but now that President Obama has supported intervention in Libya, the Sharia Law development is a sign that democracy has failed.

&nbsp;

Auster is dead on. He's also correct to ask us to look at the Afghani constitution for a similar declaration.

&nbsp;

Democracy has not failed; it has done exactly what it promised to do. In essence, it has empowered the majority. When your majority is Muslim and believe that Sharia Law should be the basis of the state structure, any outcome that doesn't promote Sharia Law would indicate a failure for democracy. The real failure was liberalism: policy makers in the West assumed that liberalism and democracy automatically went hand in hand. They were wrong and as such have empowered anti-Western forces. This is not unique to President Obama, but happened just as tragically under President Bush.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Are Hunger Strikes Effective?</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Since September 16, 2007 William Coleman, a Connecticut inmate, has been on an off-and-on hunger strike. The state has repeatedly force fed him.

Coleman, a British citizen, is protesting his incarceration and deportation order through the time-honored hunger strike. He has subsisted by drinking milk, juice, and taking nutritional supplements. At times, he has accepted only water. Coleman has protested in the only way that prisoners have to protest: by refusing food. Since the invention of the prison system, inmates have used the hunger strike to object to abuses at the hands of authorities and to raise awareness of wrongful conviction.

The state has repeatedly force-fed Coleman. They say that these measures were taken to prevent him from dying. His attorney says that Coleman should be left alone, despite Assistant Attorney General Lynn Wittenbrink's objections.

Wittenbrink is on the brink of being dim-witted. He fears that hunger strikes will place impossible obstacles before officials who want to care for prisoners while maintaining safety and security. Wittenbrink doesn't understand that a wrongfully convicted prisoner already feels themselves to be uncared for and in danger.

The state Supreme Court is considering the issue while Wittenbrink frets over copycat hunger strikers, which really suggests that inmates have grounds for protest that authorities would otherwise like to silence.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Bo Xilai&#039;s China</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Bo Xilai, a rising star in Chinese politics, has the best chance of defeating corruption in China.

Bo Xilai is the Chongqing Committee Secretary, the essential governor of that province. Between 2004 and 2007 he was the Chinese Minister of Commerce. It's expected that Bo Xilai will be tapped for a high (perhaps the highest) position in Chinese national politics at next year's people's congress.

This last week, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21534812">Bo received some harsh treatment from The Economist</a>. Walmart has come under official scrutiny for some lax standards in food safety, and Bo has been incredibly tough on the company. The Economist suggests that Bo is being unduly hard on Walmart while letting domestic companies slide on standards. Yet this accusation stands in contrast with Bo's political strategy.

Back in 2009, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14539628">Bo Xilai was featured in The Economist</a> for being one of the few Chinese politicians willing to combat corruption in the Communist Party. As The Economist points out, organized crime has been a serious problem in China and has detracted from economic growth, has endangered people's lives, and has eroded confidence in the government's ability to secure order. Bo has been fighting a very tough campaign on organized crime, arresting even members of the Communist Party when it's obvious that they've been colluding with mafia groups.

Bo has proven that he's not afraid to stand up for ordinary people even at the expense of political interests. He has attacked his friends in the Communist Party when it means protecting the broader public interest. As such, Bo's stance toward Wallmart is more easily explained. Bo is taking food safety seriously. He is likely going after the low hanging fruit in an effort to win broader support for future efforts. The broader public is thus far cynical and suspicious of the government's ability to ensure a safe food market; Bo is one of the few who seem prepared to tackle the issue. One must start somewhere.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How Old is the Earth?</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: How old is the earth according to the Bible? What happened at Creation? Is the earth, as some people claim, only 6,000 years old? How do you explain dinosaurs and times before mankind? Many people miss the deeper meaning, for if you don't understand the beginning you will never understand the end.

Let's see what the how old the earth is according to the Bible:

Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

When were the heaven and earth created? In the beginning. I know it seems pedantic, but sometimes the obvious needs to be restated. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the world was created 6,000 years ago. <em>How old is the earth, really?</em> Fossils and archeological records state that the earth is billions of years old. God's Word states it as well.

Genesis 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the waters.

The Hebrew language doesn't have a verb for "to be". Most of the time where you see "was", it's placed in italics, which means that the translators have added it to the text so that the passage makes sense. As you can see in Genesis 1:2, the verse makes little sense if it read "and darkness upon the face of the deep". But notice that the first "was" isn't in italics. This is because it is in the original language, but not in the way that the English implies.

According to the Strong's Concordance, this word "was" is:

H1961
hâyâh
haw-yaw'
A primitive root (compare H1933); to exist, that is, be or become, come to pass (always emphatic, and not a mere copula or auxiliary): - beacon, X altogether, be (-come, accomplished, committed, like), break, cause, come (to pass), continue, do, faint, fall, + follow, happen, X have, last, pertain, quit (one-) self, require, X use.

The word means "become" or "come to pass". The verse should read "And the earth became without form". The same Hebrew word is used in Genesis 2:7 where it says that man became a living soul.
So much is lost in the translation. The phrase here in 1:2 in Hebrew is tôhû vâ bôhû. Tôhû in Hebrew is:

H8414
tôhû
to'-hoo

From an unused root meaning to lie waste; a desolation (of surface), that is, desert; figuratively a worthless thing; adverbially in vain: - confusion, empty place, without form, nothing, (thing of) nought, vain, vanity, waste, wilderness.

Bôhû is this:

H922
bôhû
bo'-hoo
From an unused root (meaning to be empty); a vacuity, that is, (superficially) an undistinguishable ruin: - emptiness, void.

Bôhû is an undistinguishable ruin. It's something that's so desolate and destroyed that you can't even recognize its original form. This phrase here, with the word hâyâh means that the earth was not created tôhû, but became tôhû. Let me document.

Isaiah 45:18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.

This word "vain" in the Hebrew manuscripts is tohû. It says here that He did not create the earth tohû, which is to say desolate. I want to take you to the book of Job, in chapter 40.

Some say that the Bible states that the world is only 6,000 years old when in reality God says that it's considerably older. As you read this, I want you to think very carefully.

Job 40:15-24 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pieceth through snares.

Some say that this is talking about the hippopotamus or the elephant, but how well do you know either of these creatures? The hippopotamus lives in the water and the mud since it doesn't have any sweat glands. Its tail is small, not at all like a cedar. The elephant lives in the plains and takes food up with its trunk to eat, and doesn't graze like an ox. Its tail is like a limp piece of rope, not strong and big like a cedar tree. There's only one animal that fits this description, and that's a dinosaur. I've heard one person try and say that the behemoth is Satan, but this doesn't make any sense since God is showing Job different kinds of animals and how Job should be like some of them in dealing with trouble. Why would God tell Job to be like Satan? He wouldn't.

I also want you to read the part where it says that God made the behemoth when He made Job. Don't skip over that, it's very important. Job existed as far back as the dinosaurs, which was billions of years ago. His fleshly body didn't, but his soul did. So did Jeremiah's:

Jeremiah 1:5 "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."

Isaiah 49:1-2 Listen to me, you islands; hear this you distant nations: Before I was born the Lord called me; from my birth He has made mention of my name. He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of His hand He hid me; He made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in His quiver.

So did yours.

Ephesians 1:4-6 For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight. In love He predestined us to be adopted as His sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with His pleasure and will - to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the One He loves.

Ephesians 1:11 In Him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will.

Romans 8:29-30 For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers. And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.

John 15:26-27 When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me; but you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.

Revelation 17:8 ...The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come.

We existed in what Peter called "the world that was":

2 Peter 3:6 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.

The King James reads:

2 Peter 3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.
Peter then goes on to say that the world that is now is reserved to be destroyed by fire. Some say that Peter is talking about Noah's flood here. Is this the case? The word "perished" in the Greek:

G622
apollumi
ap-ol'-loo-mee
From G575 and the base of G3639; to destroy fully (reflexively to perish, or lose), literally or figuratively: - destroy, die, lose, mar, perish.

The word means "to destroy fully". Noah's flood didn't fully destroy the world, since vegetation still grew (the dove and the olive branch). When we ask, how old is the earth according to the Bible, we have to keep this in mind. This full destruction, let's take a look at it:

Jeremiah 4:23-26 I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone. I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying. I looked, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away. I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.

The context of this vision that was granted to Jeremiah was God's anger at His people. He said that they were fools, only practicing evil and not knowing how to do good. Basically God was saying that His people were ignorant, since God destroyed the world once before to get rid of evil and they're thinking He won't do it again.

This again isn't Noah's flood. Man still lived after that, and the flood didn't blot out the lights of heaven. And think about this, there were towns then. Cities. Ecclesiastes 1:9-11

<b>Special Study in the Greek: Themelios and Katabolê</b>

The phrase "the foundation of the world" appears often in the New Testament, but they sometimes mean different things. Two Greek words are translated as "foundation"; the first is themelios and the second is katabolê. The noun themelios is present in Luke 6:48 and 49, Luke 14:29, Acts 16:26, Romans 15:20, 1 Corinthians 3:10-12, Ephesians 2:20, 1 Timothy 9:19, 2 Timothy 2:19, Hebrews 6:1, Hebrews 11:10, Revelation 21:14 and Revelation 21:19. This word is never used concerning the world (kosmos) or the earth (gê). The verb for this word, themelioô occurs in Matthew 7:25, Luke 6:48, Ephesians 3:17, Colossians 1:23, Hebrews 1:10, and 1 Peter 5:10. Only once is it used concerning the earth, and this is in Hebrews 1:10. A review of all of these verses show that they are the correct terms for "to found" and "foundation".

The noun katabolê occurs in Matthew 13:35, Matthew 25:34, Luke 11:50, John 17:24, Ephesians 1:4, Hebrews 4:3, Hebrews 9:26, Hebrews 11:11, 1 Peter 1:20, Revelation 13:8, and Revelation 17:8. The verb for this word, kataballô occurs in 2 Corinthians 4:9, Hebrews 6:1, and Revelation 12:10. A review of these verses (especially 2 Corinthians 4:9 and Revelation 12:10) will show that katabolê and kataballô are not the correct terms for founding and foundation. Instead, the correct translation should be "casting down" or "overthrow". Consistency calls for the same translation in Hebrews 6:1, so that instead of "not laying again" it should be "not cast down". That is, that the foundation was already laid for repentance and should not be cast down or overthrown, but was to be left and progress made unto the perfection. Equally so, the noun katabolê ought to be translated as such, to be something along the lines of "ruin" or "disruption".

It is interesting to note that all occurrences, with the exception to Hebrews 11:11, the word is connected with "the world" and the word should therefore be rendered as "the disruption (or ruin) of the world". This clearly refers to the condition stated by tôhû vâ bôhû. This is further confirmed by the fact that the phrase, which occurs ten times, is associated with the preposition apo, which means "from" seven times, and the preposition pro, which means "before" three times.

When we ask ourselves, "<i>How old is the earth according to the Bible?</i>" we must ask ourselves how old is this age and what does God's Word say about the overall plan for Creation? The answer actually supports the claim that the earth is 4.6 billion years old.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Material and technical progress, the last legitimate refuge for the modern progressive mind, has now been called into question.

In the 18th century, we were promised moral progress. The intellectuals of the age promised us that we were rising above the savagery and violence of our primitive past and moving toward a bright future where even the basest of us would be blessed with the most refined moral insight. The utter barbarity of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic period, and the repressions that followed proved them wrong.

In the 19th century, they countered with a belief in economic progress. They promised us an age of abundance. The vote was split down the middle though - would economic progress come from capitalism or would it come from socialist revolution? In the 20th, with the invention of the automobile and mass communication, the intellectuals added technical progress to their creed. The world would get richer, technology would be more advanced, and our children would be better off than we.

The innovation in the concetration camp as the future of industrialized societies and the development of atomic weaponry did little to stop western civilization's blind belief in progress. The concentration camp was solved for with militant liberalism. The atomic weapon, through the great lie of "deterrance" actually prevented war.

Now with the imminent collapse of the Euro and an economic apocalypse approaching, faith in material and technical progress is being challenged in the West. This time, we may tender a small hope that this challenge will finally instruct us in the truth. For if we must suffer, let us at least know the truth.

<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/07/news/economy/wealth_gap_age/">The oldest generation is now significantly richer than the youngest</a>. Previously, there was a 10 to 1 ratio, but now it stands at 47 to 1. Compared to same-aged groups in 1984, the younger generation has seen its net worth decline 68% while the older group has seen theirs rise 42%.

The conclusion? The world might be worse, not better, for the next generation by every single benchmark. Progress is in its deathbed.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: We in America (who pay attention to such things) are baffled and horrified by the impending collapse of the Euro. It's like watching one of your friends get beaten up in school, knowing that you'd be next.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is perhaps an idiot. The Economist has called for his resignation or electoral defeat for years; they have criticised the man as he's endured various scandals and affairs. We cannot hold Mr. Berlusconi's idiocy against him, of course; many people are idiots. The blame rests on the Italian state, for they have clinged to the democratic lie, which has handed over the power of the state to a man like Silvio Berlusconi. The Italians themselves are stuck in a pitiable condition; they have been force fed democracy and national unity, and the few that have had the courage to suggest that Italy deserves better have been called idiots. There is a conflict here: either Berlusconi or those who oppose the system that created Berlusconi are idiots. We doubt that both sides are idiotic.

The Euro is collapsing. Greece will default, Italy's debt has now apparently passed the point of no return. European governments can decide to either bail each other out and face region-wide default or abandon the Euro and potentially face individual default. <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/11/italy-debt-crisis-berlusconi.html">Borrowing costs in Italy have now surpassed the 7% threshold</a>; the country is now at risk of being insolvent. Berlusconi's impending resignation will do nothing to stop the impending collapse; he is just a man.

Italy may soon join the other countries in need of a bailout; but who, friends, will bail out the bail-outters? The world will eventually run out of Berlusconis.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Ben Bernanke is Wrong About Printing Money</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke held a rare public forum in front of military families. In his remarks, he defended the insane policies that have prolonged our economic misery.

Mr. Bernanke said that <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/247130/20111110/fed-focused-intently-on-job-creation-bernanke.htm">policy makers are "intently" focused on job creation</a>. This should strike fear into the heart of every decent person. When the government focused "intently" on drug traffickers, they gave them automatic weapons to use on civilians. When government "intently" focused on poverty, they created a welfare system that is now on the verge of bankruptcy. The result of the government's "intense" focus on job creation has been an official unemployment of 9%, but as we know the actual number is much higher since it doesn't include those who have stopped looking for work or those whose benefits have expired.

The intense focus on job creation is misguided; as <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/science/economics/the-jobs-plan">we have suggested elsewhere</a>, the focus needs to be on production. When the economy produces what it should and allocates its resources efficiently, people find employment in optimal industries. Until that happens, we risk pushing people into professions they aren't fit for, thus sabotaging their futures. When the Spanish government launched "create work" programs, they captured a lot of young, unemployed workers and forced them into low-skill jobs. As a result, they gained experience in these low-skill, low-pay areas and many remained there for years after.

Mr. Bernanke also insists that printing money is an activity entirely different than government spending. He's wrong. Government spending in a time of deficit is done in one of two ways - through borrowing or through printing. Borrowing is simply borrowing against printed money in the future; printing is enduring that cost now. Both are inflationary. Both undermine trust in the monetary system.

Let us wait until Mr. Bernanke decides to intensely focus on fixing the monetary system. Then we'll be in real trouble.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Congressional Insider Trading</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Corruption is a problem for every government. Loopholes that allow it to be legally allowed should be changed.

CBS correspondent Steve Kroft reported that insider trading in Congress appears to be perfectly legal. Peter Schweizer from the Hoover Institution told Kroft that insider trading is an "honest graft" that Congressional leaders can use to become more wealthy while in office. Schweizer calls it immoral but says that insider trading laws do not apply to the elites in Congress.

Citing Congressman Spencer Bachus' bet that there would be financial turmoil in 2008, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57323527/congress-trading-stock-on-inside-information/">Schweizer and Kroft point out</a> that politicians are privy to very sensitive economic information that could be used to profit themselves. This issue is not unique to Congress; some of us still remember <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/politics/2011/08/barack-buddy-buffett-betting-bank-bailout">President Barack Obama's Bank of America tip to Warren Buffett</a>.

This is the product of a few things. First, it's the product of a general air of corruption in government. The Greeks told us that tyranny is when the public is ruled according to private interest and not for the good of everyone. Second, the government is far too involved in economic issues. If meetings where sensitive economic information was discussed simply stopped happening, political insider trading would be impossible.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Whining Continues Over Iran&#039;s Nuclear Ambitions</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Iran has taken steps to acquire atomic weapons for years, the West has complained for almost as long. Yet in that time, very few have paused to consider why Iran would want nuclear weapons in the first place.

&nbsp;

Western policy makers have a habit of calling non-Western policy makers insane or crazy. Ideologies that stand outside their accepted norm are clearly the product of mental imbalance (such is the result of the Cult of Reason). Iran has certainly been no exception. Ahmadinejad's belief in the imminent coming of the 12th Imam has been branded as crazy, his insistence that Israel is Islam's mortal enemy is insane, the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons is stupid, etc. These things are not crazy or even necessarily stupid. The belief in the 12th Imam's return is no less far fetched than that of Christ's. The insistence that Israel is Islam's mortal enemy is not as insane as insisting that JP Morgan is the mortal enemy of the working class. And plenty of countries have pursued nuclear weapons for various ideological reasons - to defeat the imperialists, the Nazis, the capitalists, and so forth. Western policy makers find Iran's stance so strange and foreign because they are secretly nihilists and don't believe in anything anymore.

&nbsp;

The terrible impact of this is clear: in a fight between Iran's version of Islam and the West, the West will lose. People want to believe in something as opposed to nothing. Politics are a product of faith, and the stronger faith wins. We in the West must learn to believe if we ever want to understand what motivates a country like Iran.

&nbsp;

Finally, let us use the current issue. Most Republican candidates attacked President Obama for intervening in Libya. We should not be spreading democracy through arms, we shouldn't be aiding unknown elements in a foreign country, and so the arguments went. Yet in their recent CBS debate, most said that they would use the CIA to foment revolution in Iran, murder scientists, topple the government, use sanctions to starve the populace, and would eventually militarily attack the country to prevent their pursuit of weapons. Recall that Libya gave up their pursuit of nuclear weapons years ago and were still subverted by Western forces. Now consider Pakistan, which openly aids American enemies, but has a nuclear weapon. There's a lot of whining, and in some quarters a call for an end to foreign aid, but very few want to bomb Pakistan. Ask yourself: if you were Iran, would you stop pursuing a nuclear weapon?]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The infamous debt reduction committee has failed. The bipartisan silver bullet has proven to be worthless. Are we surprised?

Touted as the bipartisan answer to America’s looming deficit problem, the so-called super committee has all but thrown in the towel. A few months ago, President Obama and Congress agreed to abide by whatever decisions the panel came up with, since without a resolution there would be serious across the board budget cuts. In effect, Congress held a loaded gun to its own head, saying that it was try or die for the country’s fiscal problems. Whether they will pull the metaphorical trigger and go through with the cuts remains to be seen.

As this author has said many times, the world is facing a moral crisis. The economic situation is a mere syndrome of the disease. The politicians we rail against, the slumped stock market, and the endless fighting around the world are all side effects of the great spiritual malady that infects our culture.

The solution does not rest with the politicians, the stock market, the Federal Reserve, or anything else. The solution is in our hearts.

The super committee’s failure will be followed with the typical fighting. The real short-coming of any bipartisan effort is the obvious point of exit for each of the members: if something fails, the other side can be blamed.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Two slightly different stories of Jesus Christ cursing a fig tree are presented in the New Testament. The timeline of events holds significance for what message is being taught.


Christ’s curse occurs in two places: in the book of Matthew and the book of Mark.  The passages are as follows.

<b>Matthew 21:10-22:</b>
Matthew 21:10  And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
Matthew 21:11  And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew 21:12  And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
Matthew 21:13  And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
Matthew 21:14  And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Matthew 21:15  And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,

<b>Analysis - Why did Jesus Christ Curse the Fig Tree?</b>

Jesus arrives in Jerusalem riding on a donkey (as we find in the prior verses).  Zechariah 9:9 documents that the true king will ride to Jerusalem on a donkey, preceding the day when the Lord destroys the enemies of Israel. Upon his arrival, he casts out people who polluted the temple.  In Matthew 21:13 Jesus states "It is written" and quotes a composite of two verses: Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11.  This chapter of Isaiah promises salvation to any who keep pure the Sabbaths and the house of God while Jeremiah calls on Israel to repent from idolatry and of polluting the house of God.  The lesson of the cursed tree is in relation to the entire Christian community and refers to a particular struggle between false gods and the true God.  Matthew 21:16 has Jesus saying "Have ye not read" and this refers to Psalms 8:2.  It reads "Out of the mouth of babes and suckling has thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger."  The enemy, naturally, is Satan (the word "Satan" in Hebrew means "Adversary" or enemy).  The lesson of the tree concerns the struggle with Satan and those who serve him.  Any time figs are utilized in the Bible, it refers to the controversy between <i>Civitas Dei</i> and the <i>Civitas Diaboli</i> - those who serve God and those who serve Satan.  We find in Genesis 3:7 that after the serpent (which is Satan as documented in Revelation 12:9) tempted Adam and Eve, they discovered that they were naked and sewed together aprons of fig leaves to hide their sin.  The enemies of God and those who Satan actively utilizes for his purpose are bad figs, those who serve God are good figs.  Jeremiah 24 has God giving Jeremiah two baskets of figs that look the same, but in one basket are good figs and in the other are bad figs.  God promises to provide for the good figs and to destroy the bad.

In Mark, the order of events is changed.  Jesus enters the temple first, then leaves before throwing out the moneychangers.  After leaving Bethany he is hungry but finds no fruit, kills the tree right there, then goes and casts out the moneychangers.  This documents that the exchange between Christ and those in the temple is related to the teaching of the tree; the apparent contradiction serves to draw attention to the importance of the lesson.

So what does this mean for the curse?  We have some information so far: Christ has an exchange with enemies of God - bad figs, who run the temple.  To say very plainly that the identification of the bad figs with the priests is accurate, since this same group would plot to crucify Christ and would later conspire to murder Paul.  Just as Christ cast out the moneychangers, he strikes the fig tree and promises the disciples that they can do the same.  Further, his words to the disciples state that they can cast down mountains, which in prophecy have signified nations and governments.  The first lesson of the tree is that Christ gives his followers power over their enemies so long as they believe in that power.  The believer has power over their enemies with the aid of Christ (Luke 10:19).  The interaction of the Old Testament verses and books that are quoted in these passages show that the lesson instructs us that God takes care of his own, even if this means casting down governmental powers.

But why did the tree have no fruit?  We can find the answer by looking at the Parable of the Fig Tree, which discusses a fig tree without fruit:
Matthew 24:31  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Matthew 24:32  Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
Matthew 24:33  So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
Matthew 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
It appears also in Mark in similar words.  In Luke, we see this:
Luke 21:29  And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
Luke 21:30  When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.
Luke 21:31  So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
Luke 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
Fig trees are not planted with a seed, but are set out in shoots.  So when the fig trees are set out, the final generation is near and Christ will return soon.  The second lesson of the tree was to demonstrate that the time of the end is not yet.  Matthew 17:10-13 discusses this fact - if people received John the Baptist as Elijah, then the time would have been right.  The scribes said "Elijah must come first" before the end, but Elijah did come but was rejected.  Christ kills the tree because it is not yet time, but he is hungry for that time.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Shopping Center Sizes and Bubble Economies</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/science/economics/shopping-center-sizes-and-bubble-economies</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: We often think that economic bubbles are complex, distant phenomena that effect primarily stock prices, financial instruments, and whose primary effect is job loss. We often overlook some of the other effects that stare us square in the face as we do our Christmas shopping.

Depending on where you live, shopping centers are sometimes taken for granted. They seem to randomly pop up, are of appropriate size (or inappropriate if you live down the street from one) and centralize the stores people most frequent in one general area. However, there is some science to their existence and placement.

<a href="http://www.icsc.org/index.php">The International Council of Shopping Centers</a> (ICSC) is an industrial organization founded in 1957 with the aim of educating people on shopping center development, advocating on behalf of members in issues of public policy, and developing international standards for shopping centers. Based a lot, at least from what I can tell, on central place theory, the ICSC has come up with some basic definitions for different types of shopping centers. In a nutshell, the larger the center, the larger the trade area is – with a few caveats.

If we were to loosely define a bubble as a period of quick economic growth that consisted of mis-allocating capital, we may expect to see some bending of the guidelines for shopping centers. Housing, as we know, was expanding so quickly that everyone assumed that there would be more people living in an area than there actually would be.

<a href="http://www.newrules.org/retail/rules/store-size-caps/store-size-cap-turlock-ca">In 2007</a>, several cities in California and Arizona began enacting legislation to limit store sizes. Presumably this was done under some notion to “protect small business.” However, the frequency of the legislation hints that retailers were in a buying mood in 2007, allocating capital for larger and larger stores. Galt, CA has a population of a little over 23,000 people and according to Wikipedia is bordered entirely by unincorporated areas of San Joaquin and Sacramento county. While cities such as San Diego, and Santa Clara have larger market areas, Galt and Stockton don't seem to be able to support huge retailers.

A further examination of the central valley retail market reveals other disparities. Stockton, CA (291,000 pop.) has two indoor shopping malls. Modesto, CA (201,000 pop.) has one. Tracy, CA (82,000 pop.) has one.

<a href="http://www.weberstown.com/directory">Both</a> <a href="http://sherwoodmall.com/interactive-directory.htm">malls</a> in Stockton have three anchors.

<a href="http://www.shopvintagefairemall.com/Map/">The mall in Modesto</a> has four anchors.

<a href="http://www.westvalleymall.com/directory">The mall in Tracy</a> has three anchors with space for a fourth. The Modesto and Stockton malls all have indoor walking space at a width of 30 feet, while Tracy has width at 45 feet.

In other words, this one region has four super regional malls. <a href="http://www.turlockjournal.com/section/12/article/12428/">The local counties</a> have unemployment rates around 14 to 16 percent. Bubble anyone?]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Schizophrenia of American Politics</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: I believe that your actions should reflect your beliefs. In our age, this is a radical and dangerous stance because we are surrounded with people who are suffering from spiritual schizophrenia. A slight symptom of this schizophrenia can be seen in the current payroll tax debate.

&nbsp;

The American Democratic Party has a reputation for being progressive and liberal. Therefore, their opposition, the Republican Party, does the exact opposite of what the Democratic Party wants done. This allows the Republicans to tell everyone that they're conservative when they're secretly suffering from the same political maladies as the Democrats. <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/05/ol7-ugly-truth-about-government.html">Moldbug laid much of this out</a> when he distinguished between the Inner and the Outer Parties in the United States.

&nbsp;

The problem with progressivism is its inconsistency. Proponents say that they believe in freedom, and then define that freedom in such a way that we are enslaved to the material. They stand up for universal rights and in the process end up dehumanizing and demonizing their opponents. They want self-determination for other countries but only at gunpoint. They tell society for 150 years that we must consume in order to be prosperous and now they tell us consumption will destroy the planet. What the Republican Party has done is turn Democratic inconsistency on its head. They have, in a word, decided to be insane in a different direction because they are essentially mirroring insanity.

&nbsp;

And so it is inevitable that Republican leaders will fight with Democratic leaders. So when <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-09/loaded-up-payroll-tax-cut-bills-set-to-collide-in-congress.html">we read in Business Week</a> that US Speaker of the House John Boehner and the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are preparing to fight over taxes this week, we are not surprised. Yet we are surprised that this is a continuation of a struggle between Republican representatives and a Democratic president, with the president on the side of extending tax cuts and the Republicans, at least initially, being opposed.

&nbsp;

The Republican opposition stemmed from the fact that this tax cut isn't paid for and would increase the deficit, which contradicted the earlier stances that tax cuts increase government revenue as more production from the economic growth that's supposed to be stimulated from tax cuts leads to more income being taxed. Now the Republicans in Congress are saying that extending the tax cut is acceptable as long as some random pipeline project is approved. The pipeline is obviously needed for jobs, because the problem in this country (as both parties agree) is that Americans aren't working hard enough. Democrats in the Senate have said that they want to levy a different tax to make up for the budget shortfall from the payroll tax. This makes complete sense; stubbing your toe will distract you from your headache.

&nbsp;

Nothing the US Government spends is paid for; all of it's either printed or borrowed. In that spirit, here is the 5-Part Mark Tully Plan for a Balanced Budget:

&nbsp;

1. Eliminate all but the income tax, which is cut to 10%.

2. Eliminate the Department of Education.

3. Eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency.

4. Eliminate the State Department, this is Sparta.

5. SHUT ALL OF IT DOWN NOW!

&nbsp;

We will have a budget surplus in three years. We also might have morals again.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The United States Congress has just frozen $700 million in aid to Pakistan, in the name of stopping terrorism, promoting world peace, and saving ponies. While perhaps justified, the incident serves as a reminder for us that international liberalism neither stops terrorism, promotes world peace, nor saves ponies.

Ultimately liberalism is coercive and inhumane. I will never be one to argue that the world can survive without coercion, but I will suggest that there are ways to create conditions that are less violent.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/13/us-pakistan-usa-idUSTRE7BC0QI20111213">The current situation with Pakistan</a> provides a perfect example. For several years, our aid money has contributed to the overall corruption and dependence of the country. One may argue that we have been giving money to a corrupt country, but this would overlook the insidious nature of western dollars. They are a bribe for services, and when you're already poor you begin to become dependent on the money. (Not to mention the fact that the money is itself a lie; it's all printed or borrowed, none of it actually exists at the time it's given.)

The continuous flow of money has created a country that is both dependent on funds and resentful of them; no one plans on remaining a prostitute forever. So you begin to associate yourself with competing gangs in hopes of getting out, but you never quite get out.

America, of course, gets upset. First, they provided billions in aid to Pakistan. Second, they saved the country from dictatorship. And now Pakistan responds by being downright ungrateful, so the powers that be decide to pull the funding.

We would suggest that liberalism is much more inhumane and coercive than other systems because all of this is done in the name of humanity. When one acts on behalf of humanity, then the enemies are implicitly sub-human and are worthy of destruction. The Crusades might have been bad, my friends, but most of the time armies fought against armies. Very rarely was the decision made to starve out entire countries, which is what pulling the plug on international aid and enacting sanctions does.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>New Poll: Marriage On the Retreat</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Wait, I thought the promotion of feminism, gay marriage, universal education, etc. all had a nil or positive effect on marriage? It seems we were lied to.

A new Pew Research Center poll shows that only about half of US adults are married, which is the lowest percentage point the country has ever seen. Pew says that marriage has been "in retreat" for 40 years and that the recession has accelerated its decline. Marriage is less likely to play a central role in our lives and is less likely to impact our children's perception of family.

Pew notes that 72% of adults were married in 1960. Since then that number has dropped to 51%. Adults in America are also putting off marriage, saying that they spend their 20's trying to "find themselves" and have decided to marry at a later age. Cohabitation (called "living in sin" in the old days) and single parent households have become more common. Getting married and becoming a parent are increasingly being viewed as separate activities. In 2010, 40% of Americans said that marriage was becoming obsolete.

What this points to is another element of growing social atomization. First (at least to my knowledge) hypothesized by Aristotle, breaking up the social fiber of a society is the prerequisite to tyranny. The family has always been the basis of a healthy society. With its decline, people are less connected to each other, don't trust each other as much, and have less loyalty to any existing community. Tyranny has been classicaly defined as the rule according to a person's or a people's self-interest rather than to a higher standard of good. Since the 1960's, there has been an almost complete penetration of the tyranny of selfishness and social atomization.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The government gets everything wrong, except when it kills people.

Back during the healthcare reform debate, Republican politicians and various libertarian groups came out against Obama's and Clinton's suggestions. They claimed in many cases that the reforms would put critical medical decisions in the hands of distant bureaucrats rather than patients, creating the ever-feared "<a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2010/12/27/bio-3235/">death panels</a>" that would tyrannically make life and death decisions for citizens.

I too, despite my extremism, am comfortable saying that I can sympathize with an anti-death-panel position. I don't particularly like when people make life and death decisions based off of economic calculus; I think it's bad for society, bad for the soul, and bad for the people who are subject to the decisions.

So imagine my shock (not really, I'm far too jaded) when Republican candidates took some very frightening pro-death-panel positions in the recent primary debates.

First, there was the question about Texas' rate of execution. Rick Perry who, mind you, <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/texas-people/rick-perry/under-perry-executions-raise-questions/">killed a man</a> just to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0Vt7E7U7w&amp;ob=av3n">watch him die</a>, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/12/death-sentences-plummet-which-texas-leads-states-executions.html">has never struggled</a> with the possibility that the government could sometimes kill someone who didn't deserve to die. The process is, in other words, infallible. <a href="http://blog.chron.com/rickperry/2011/09/texas-executions-get-rounds-of-applause-at-republican-debate/">The audience flat out clapped</a> when it was said that Perry's Texas has the highest execution rate in the country. Don't tread on me indeed.

Second, there was the issue of the killing of Anwar Al-Awlaki, a US born alleged cleric for Al Qaeda. President Obama decided to kill a man, presumably also to watch him die. The US military flew a drone out and killed the fellow. When candidates were asked about the issue, most were in favor of it. When the host pressed Gingrich on the issue, asking if he was really ok with letting the president unilaterally decide to kill an American citizen, Newt responded by saying that the president did not unilaterally decide; the decision was made by...<a href="http://www.fireandreamitchell.com/2011/11/13/newt-gingrich-destroys-smug-cbs-hack-scott-pelley-on-the-killing-of-anwar-al-awlaki-pelley-whines-no/">a panel</a>.

Rest assured, Republicans will save you from the evils of the welfare state (sometimes) and will empower the government to do what it does best: kill people.

Lest anyone be confused, I'm not against capital punishment. I just think we shouldn't trust a modern, liberal government to decide who should die.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Western media is so funny. The headline "Young Heir Faces Uncertain Transition in North Korea" is kind of a lie.

The news to hit over the weekend was that Kim Jong-il passed away. The Dear Leader had been suffering from an assortment of ailments for some time, and rumors of his death had circulated before. State media in the communist kingdom confirmed the death, which in all reality probably took place several months ago. [Edit: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/19/kim-jong-ils-public-appearance-photo_n_1157998.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003">These photos </a>actually support my claim that Kim Jong-il has been dead for some time. Dressing a fellow up in a big coat, dark glasses, and a hat is kind of suspicious. And if my eyes don't deceive me, isn't that the new Dear Leader standing directly behind and to the right of the lady who is trailing the imposter?)

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/world/asia/an-enigmatic-young-son-steps-forward-or-seems-to.html">The New York Times claims</a> that Kim Jong-un, Dear Leader's son, is stepping forward with "uncertainty." The Times likely believes this because they couldn't figure out what Kim Jong-un even looked like until some time last year. Kim Jong-un had been tapped as heir apparent last year, and his father has used the time since his stroke to solidify his son's image as the next leader.

The Times is skeptical that the new leader can prevent confrontation with the West and the collapse of the North Korean economy. They have taken a lot of things on faith.

I would suggest that Kim Jong-il has been dead for several months. I would also pose that the former leader did not want to name an heir because the heir might try to get rid of him; after his stroke, it was clear that the late Kim was on his way out, and thus not in need of any early prompting. I may also put forward the idea that anyone who had mastered the art of terror to the level that Kim Jong-il did probably got rid of any opposition to his heir a long time ago.

The new regime will likely last some time. After all, these are the people who <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7578231.stm">invented the hunger-quenching noodle</a>; a regime of such ingenuity can handle losing one guy.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In a show of unbridled intelligence, Newt Gingrich has found the perfect way to restore the supremacy of the US Constitution: arrest all the non-Constitutional judges.

The Onion couldn't write better material. Newt Gingrich suggested recently that the cure to unconstitutional judicial rulings is to force all dissenting judges to testify before Congress. In a perfectly serious and sincere tone, Gingrich advocated sending US Marshalls to apprehend judges who ruled in a way that would-be President Gingrich felt to be unconstitutional.

The candidate's comments came after his popularity began to slip in Iowa; both Ron Paul and Rick Perry have been running negative ads against the Gingrich campaign in efforts to carve away his sway with voters. The efforts by and large seem to be working. We at Restorus are curious to see if Newt's pledge for a Stalinist purge of the counterrevolutionaries will help any. If it does not, either Romney or Paul will likely win the nomination. If it does help, we will have to conclude that Iowa is not the state for us. And that a career as a judge suddenly became much more dangerous.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Useless Immigration Hotline Set Up by Feds</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) fought the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and won, supposedly. The ACLU claimed that police forces were wrongfully detaining citizens who get caught up in deportation dragnets. The feds have now set up a hotline that people can call, but this won't help for three reasons.

First, an arrested person isn't likely to have access to the number when they're in jail. If the jails are so overcrowded and underfunded that <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/feds-set-hotline-u-s-citizens-call-wrongfully-held-immigration-detention-article-1.998560?localLinksEnabled=false">this man</a> couldn't even get a bed for four days, then I doubt they'll have the resources or motivation to post the telephone number everywhere.

Second, as alluded to, the jails are overcrowded. Jail overcrowding means that it takes longer for inmates to reach and use telephones.

Third, if someone is held on an immigration hold, it's possible that they'll be transported to a federal facility. During the transit process, a person's access to telephones is severely diminished and if a person feels unsafe and goes into protective custody, they generally only have access to phones for 15 minutes every 30 days (most American State and Federal prisons seem to list this on their sites). Since the hotline presumably goes to a person and not a lawyer, the person probably wouldn't get a longer call.

This is simply politics as usual.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The fascists are at it again.

It may soon become a crime in Israel to compare people to Nazis. The bill that's currently being considered would impose a fine up to $25,000 and six months in jail for criticizing people by making mention of Nazis, the Holocaust, and using Nazi symbolism in a purpose other than teaching, documentation, or research.

Cabinet ministers <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_HOLOCAUST?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-01-10-06-38-46">passed the bill</a> Monday, sending it to parliament for final review. The bill was written in response to ultra-Orthodox demonstrations that dressed young boys as concentration camp inmates. The protestors also have called the police Nazis.

Civil rights groups have criticized the bill saying that it infringes on people's freedom of expression.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin's Law</a> states that any online argument or discussion that continues long enough will result in some comparison to Naziism. Sometimes referred to as the <i>Reductio ad Hitlerium</i>, this argument has been a mainstay of internet discourse for several years. It's quite clear to me that the Nazis in the Israeli parliament would essentially stifle all online discourse with the bill, not to mention the other implications for free expression.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: By freezing atoms to close to absolute zero, researchers at IBM have been able to get individual atoms to store data.

&nbsp;

For decades, magentic media has been king. By skrinking feature size, data storage professionals have been able to improve speed and storage. However you can only make your magentic atom clusters so small; it becomes very difficult to set the atoms without wiping out neighboring data.

&nbsp;

IBM may have just found a solution. They have started using antoferromagnetism to store a bit in a feature that's as small as six iron atoms large. This tiny feature is huge; it potentially allows for more data storage than the current technology could even dream of. The downside is that the iron atoms must be reduced to near zero temperatures. Absolute zero is a theoretical temperature that's about -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit or -273.15 degrees Celsius. The atomic particles could get as "warm" as 5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin">Kelvin</a> before the data disappeared.

&nbsp;

Of course, special equipment would have to be used in order to read the data stored on such clusters. If researchers can gain atomic-level precision in a miniaturized device and if they're able to get antiferromagnetic materials to retain their data at room temperatures (or build really cold data storage facilities), then computer storage is about to drop in price.

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Yesterday, a group of popular sites such as Wikipedia, Mozilla, and Reddit - and some less popular sites such as this one, went dark to protest two laws currently before the US Congress. The House of Representative's Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Senate's Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP, or PIPA for short) were written to stop copyright infringement.

Under the proposed law, American hosting companies, advertising platforms, and search engines would all be required to "stop consorting with copyright infringers." Major players across the internet have been firmly opposed to the bills. Many sites such as Wikipedia, which rely on users to contribute content, are at risk under such a law. Entire websites can be shut down for merely linking to content that violates copyright.

Restorus joined the protest, not because we have a large audience, but because it might mean the end for many smaller sites such as this one. The bill could be a real detriment to sites that lack the resources to fully verify everybody they link to. Internet service providers would also have to block traffic to "offending sites" or face prison sentences.

Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, says that SOPA supporters argue that the bill targets only "foreign rogue websites", the reach is not limited to just foreign or pirate sites. The law is written in such a way as to allow shutting down an entire website over one offending link posted by a user, and not even the site owner.

The House and the Senate are currently considering a watered down version of the bill called the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN) which would focus primarily on non-American sites and (gasp) include provisions for judicial oversight. What happens remains to be seen.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov warned that western support for the Arab Spring could lead to "a very big war that will cause suffering not only to countries in the region, but also to states far beyond its boundaries."

The foreign minister, who holds a news conference once a year, used this occasion to criticize foreign involvement in the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Lavrov promised a Russian veto in the United Nations against any move to send troops into troubled countries like Syria. He said that Russia would likely be unable to prevent foreign intervention in Syria, but that any such intervention should take place on a unilateral basis.

Syria has of course been prominent in western news lately for the violent crackdown that's been taking place against insurrectionary forces in the country. The Arab League and many in the West have called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to put an end to the violence, but it's clear that as long as the insurrection poses a threat to his government he will try to stop it.

During his conference, Mr. Lavrov accused the United States of attempting to overthrow the Russian government. Mr. Lavrov has, of course, been one of the few public officials in any country to identify (at least openly) the United States as the instigator of the Arab uprisings. The foreign minister warned that the United States and others were arming extremists in Syria, while the American ambassador accused Russia of supplying the incumbent government with munitions.

Michael McFaul, the current American ambassador to Moscow, has been attacked in the Russian media as "not being an expert on Russia" but instead being "an expert on promoting democracy." Readers of this site will note that all American ambassadors are mere missionaries for the democratic cause.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The European Union continues to struggle to cope with the massive financial blackhole that is Greece. In short, default is both inevitable and the only real solution.

In December, the International Monetary Fund reviewed the Greek economy and released a set of findings that shows how impossible any easy fix will be for the Mediterranean country. The IMF states that even if almost every private creditor decided to write off half of what's owed to them, Greek debt would still stand at a staggering 120% of GDP by 2020. It's more likely that creditors will agree to write off a significantly smaller portion; another debt restructuring would be necessary in the future.

Up to this point, the EU has refused to consider default an option, but with the numbers looking the way they are it is basically an inevitability. And with the European Central Bank being, quite likely, the largest holder of Greek debt, such a default would impact the rest of the economic coalition.

What's being discussed now is "Private-Sector Involvement" (PSI), which is nothing more than a plan to impose all the losses on the private creitors rather than the governments that hold these bonds. It isn't likely that any deal will avoid Greek default and the governmental organizations that hold these bounds will eventually eat the losses. The Euro probably won't survive 2012.

In response to the massive overspending that governments like Greece have undertaken in recent years, the Eurozone is currently debating a new treaty that would impose stricter budget rules on member-states. Under the treaty, European governments could sue each other in the European Court of Justice if they suspect one another of failing to work to keep their deficits within the new limits. If the accusing state wins, the court could impose a fine of up to 0.1 percent of the losing state's GDP, which would be paid into the Eurozone's new bailout fund.

EU leaders are set to discuss such measures today.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Iran is Bluffing About the Strait of Hormuz</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Oil prices rose to close to $100 per barrel and natural gas prices jumped 7% as Iran reiterated its threat to block shipments of crude oil from the Persian Gulf. Iran claims it will go ahead with the blockade if the West follows through on its threat to embargo the country.

Much to the applause of the United States and Israel, the European Union agreed to stop buying Iranian oil after July and froze assets of Iran's central bank. Politicians state that the goal of such measures is to force the beleagured country into talks with the West about its nuclear program. The embargo won't have much of an effect; Iran will simply divert oil to China at below-market rates, which in turn will cause China to buy less from other countries that sell to Europe.

Iran is lying. They simply don't have the ability to stop international commerce any more than they had the ability to send their navy to the Atlantic seaboard.

Navies are incredibly expensive to operate. They're even more expensive to use in active conflict with a superior force. The United States already has ships in the area and would retaliate in the event of any serious disruption in trade through the Strait of Hormuz. One supporting piece of evidence is America's overall reluctance to allow even themselves to interrupt trade that it feels is of strategic importance. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/01/23/congress-could-exempt-key-bp-project-from-new-iran-sanctions/">Witness BP's probable exception</a> from American sanctions in hopes of weaning Europe off of Russian oil.

The entire thing is a game. Iran's problem is that they have no credibility in their threats and no strategy to unify their actions - that and the United States has more guns.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: A special report in this week's <i>Economist</i> on state-owned enterprises in emerging markets validates one of my theories - classical, small-state liberalism eventually morphs into the modern, welfare-state governments that we see today. The moral is that any time material interests dominate the political, the former will eventually use tools of coercion to force out rivals.

In the 1990's with the fall of the Soviet Union, it was thought that state owned enterprises in emerging markets would eventually be dismantled in favor of more open trade systems. However, they don't seem to be going away. As the <i>Economist</i> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21542931">reports</a>, the world's ten largest oil and gas companies are state-owned and state-backed firms make up 80% and 62% of China's and Russia's stock markets respectively.

Brazil, South Africa, and other emerging countries are considering similar models. Supporters of state capitalism argue that it can provide stability and growth to an otherwise unstable free market. Infrastructure would especially be benefited because the state can quickly mobilize resources for large scale projects. Arguments in favor of state-owned enterprises have generally relied on the belief that some activities of public importance can be done most efficiently when one firm manages the market.

We are seeing a few developments.

First, emerging markets are opting toward state capitalism instead of toward a more free market model. They are marrying politics with economics in order to try and take advantage of diminishing returns.

Second, state-owned enterprises are being consolidated. Governments are being very selective in which state-backed firms they allow to survive. This means the overall number of firms has shrunk, but the size of the ones that remains has grown.

Third, state-owned enterprises are becoming more productive. In China for instance, the return on assets for government-owned companies has increased from 0.7% in 1998 to 6.3% in 2006. However, this is mainly because the government companies are better at copying what the private sector does than because of any real economic advantage.

I would argue that the growth of state-owned enterprises in emerging markets shows us our future. The vested interests of the heirs of the classical liberal tradition aren't as prevalent in these countries. Instead we see modern politicians who are free to carry out the promise of their ideologies with very little opposition. The <i>Economist</i> would have you believe that this is the result of the current crisis of Western free market liberalism. Yet they overlook the fact that liberalism is the crisis; what we're seeing in the West are the birth pangs of what's already coming to be in emerging markets.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Spain, Italy, Belgium, Slovenia, and Cyprus were downgraded by Fitch Ratings. The agency claims that the Eurozone countries lack the appropriate financial flexibility to deal with the regional debt crisis. Surprise.

Italy was cut two points from an A+ rating to an A-. Spain was also lowered two points from AA- to A. Belgium was slashed from AA+ to AA. Slovenia found itself facing the same cut as Spain. Cyprus was pared to BBB- from BBB. The countries may be downgraded again within two years.

Fitch warned Europe about the pending downgrades last month when negotiations about Greek debt came to an impasse. The rating agency doesn't feel that Europe is capable of handling the financial panic that would follow a default by a larger country such as Greece. Fitch's report said, "The divergence in monetary and credit conditions across the euro zone and near-term economic outlook highlight the greater vulnerability" that would come from financial shocks. "These sovereigns do not, in Fitch's view, accrue the full benefits of the euro's reserve-currency status."

The report was followed by some hand-wringing and apologizing from law makers in various parts of the world. European leaders are scheduled confer about future conferences on January 30th in Brussels.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The Chinese economy has experienced double digit growth for a long time. Now that things are slowing, authorities worry that the general public will become restless as things aren't moving as fast as promised. Across China, a number of protests have been taking place that signal a growing unrest in the country.

China recently announced that it will increase police forces in the Xinjiang region. Xinjiang has appeared in the news occasionally because the government has been targeting the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people who make up 40% of the region's population. China worries that the Uighurs and other ethnic groups may cause unrest if growth doesn't continue at a normal rate. The Uighurs have long been attacked for practicing their faith and for wanting to establish an independent East Turkestan.

Last week, secen Tibetans were killed in a clash with Chinese security forces in the Sichuan province. Buddhist worshippers have been at odds with the authorities for years. China has, of course, blamed outside interference for the violence. They say that the West has funded the Dalai Lama and have spread rumors, saying that the Dalai Lama is a separatist. The Dalai Lama has said that he only wants autonomy for Tibet and a peaceful solution to the issues; in other words, separation.

A recent cadmium spill in southern China threatened the water supply for 1.5 million people. The Chinese government has tested the water and assures everyone that it's safe. Cadmium is used in batteries and paint, and can cause kidney dysfunction and cancer when consumed. Huang Shiyong, the Communist Party Chief for the city of Hechi has promised to "severely crack down" on polluting companies. Environmental contamination has been tolerated in China as a necessary price for economic growth, but now that the economy is slowing people are increasingly becoming restless.

Workers also went in strike in an industrial zone near the capital of the Sichuan province. The three day strike was surprising since it occurred at a state-owned enterprise. They demanded higher wages. Many workers earned $190 a month and the resolution to the strike, a promised additional $41 a month, is seen as not enough to live on.

Unrest will likely continue. It will be interesting to see if any foreign powers try to take advantage of China's weakened state.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Three Digitization Trends That are Disrupting Publishing and Media Industries</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Some very exciting things are taking place in technology. These developments are making it easy for disruptive, non-mainstream sites and views to be more accessible. Let's take a look at three primary trends that are reshaping the content industry.
<b>1. E-Readers and Tablets</b>

The PC put a computer on every desk in every office and home. However, the reading experience was somewhat formalized. One usually had to go to the desk, at least until the development of lightweight laptops. But even those devices take up more space than is always convenient. With the development of low-cost tablet PC's and e-readers, the content industry is forced to contend with truly personal devices.

E-readers disrupt traditional publishing models by how easy they make it to transfer content. Old publishing companies had to forecast potential book sales before going to print, making the industry very heierarchical. The barriers to entry often forced out smaller, lesser known writers and led to a virtual cartelization as publishers determined who published and how many books were printed. It also led to a situation of fairly strict price controls; publishers would decide on the price of a book and retailers would comply. E-readers changed that because the cost of production dropped so significantly. The only barrier is the one-time cost of digitizing the work and reformatting it in a way that works with e-reader software. Smaller authors can publish, larger authors can no longer charge as much for their works. While many publishers are still insisting on the old pricing model, it's not likely they'll be able to do so forever.

Tablets have done a similar thing to online media. The numbers show that more people use tablets during the hours when they're home than they do other devices. The iPad, the Samsung Galaxy, and a score of other gadgets are invited into the home and into more relaxed settings. Content is often more intimate, since it must literally be touched in order to be consumed.
<b>2. Free Technology and Content</b>

Most online news sources have been placing their content behind paywalls. They've done this because they cannot support themselves on advertising revenue alone. The reason why advertising revenue has fallen so dramatically in recent years is painfully obvious: the news has become irrelevant. If newspapers had something interesting to say, they would have plenty of pageviews and plenty of advertisers to fill the space. The paywall model is a temporary fix that relies on squeazing more money out of people who are invested in the newspaper regardless of quality - business owners, lawyers, politicians, people ignorant of other information sources, etc. It falls apart the instant a free alternative emerges.

And they are emerging. This article hints that newspapers are blissfully ignorant of the independent publishers about to rain on their parade. With very little overhead and surprisingly relevant things to say,
<b>3. Personalization</b>

The rise of social-reader applications mean that content is being displayed based on personal preferences. People are getting more of what they want and they're getting it more easily. With improving search engine algorithms and an increased interconnectivity between people with like interests, people are able to personalize their content more than they could before. We are living in a time when people grab a camera and make a documentary on their own, instead of waiting for a major news outlet to do so.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Only nuts would suggest that the earth isn't suffering from human-made warming. A new report from NASA that shows that global temperatures were lower in 2011 than 1998 proves that government scientists are pretty nutty.

A new NASA study reveals that global temperatures were lower in 2011 than in 1998. The media and climate scientists still argue that the earth is warming, despite data that points the contrary. The Associated Press said on January 20th that, "The world last year wasn't quite as warm as it has been for most of the past decade, government scientists said Thursday, but it continues a general trend of rising temperatures." The statement is laughable. The "trend" is completely dependent on the period of time being measured; if we start in 1998, the trend shows that the world is getting cooler. If we start at the peak of the last ice age, there's a distinctive warming trend.

NASA scientists say that the data is "suggestive of a slowdown in global warming, this apparent slowdown may largely disappear as a few more years of data are added." The scientists have largely left the realm of science; temperatures may do any number of things in the next few years but the information we have only shows what they have done in the past. Any supposition about a general "trend" up or down is purely speculative and is based on best guesses, which are always guesses at the end of the day.

"It would be premature to make any conclusion that we would see any hiatus of the longer-term warming trend," said Tom Karl, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center. "Global temperatures are continuing to increase." It would seem that it's premature to even suggest that there's any trend at all, and certainly premature to say that global temperatures are continuing to increase when they've dropped over the last ten years.

The truth is that there are no average temperatures. Climate history is the story of incredible changes as we experience ice ages, geologic shifts, and different seasons. The only certain thing is that our climate has and will always be very uncertain. The warming community will always return to old articles of faith to justify their position.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: <i>Amazing Grace</i> is one of the most recognizable songs in the English-speaking world. Its message of redemption through the mercy of God have inspired the faithful since it was first penned.

The English poet and Christian leader John Newton wrote the lyrics to <i>Amazing Grace</i> in 1779. Newton himself matured without any particular religious conviction, but once during a storm he weathered as a sailor in the Royal Navy, he was so terrified that he cried out to God for mercy. This act of repentance and humility eventually put him on the path for theological studies.

<i>Amazing Grace</i> likely didn't have any music when it was first written. The chorus may have just been chanted by church congregations. In Britain, the song wasn't very popular, but it was extremely influential in America's Second Great Awakening in the 19th century.

<b>The Lyrics to Amazing Grace:</b>

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.

<i>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,</i>
<i>That saved a wretch like me.</i>
<i>I once was lost but now am found,</i>
<i>Was blind, but now I see.</i>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Is Gang Violence Linked to Drugs?</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: For years, the United States Government has prosecuted drug and gang crimes, and prosecutors have assumed that the two were related. In a new tur war between the Center for Disease Control and law enforcement, the CDC suggests that gang violence stems from other causes.

<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6103a2.htm">The CDC report</a> compares gang and non-gang homicides between 2003 and 2008 and concludes that gang-related killings are more likely to be attributed to other causes like retalitory violence. The data was collecte from the National Violent Death Reporting System for Los Angeles, Oakland CA, Long Beach CA, Oklahoma City, and Newark NJ, which all have a high prevalence of gang violence. NVRDS collects violent death information from death reports, medical records, and law enforcement statements.

We should at least be a little cautious when considering the results, since people aren't likely to be forthcoming about their reasons for killing others. The CDC has in fact questioned the validity of the data in their report, saying that gang homocide case definitions vary depending on who is consulted. Some agencies record any homocide that involves gang members as being a related homocide, while others require gang-related motives.

What's unique and interesting about the report is that the CDC came up with their conclusion despite the questionability of the data. To the conspiratorial mind, or at least the mind that believes that government bureaucrats don't waste time on reports that don't materially benefit them (and also perhaps to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465007856/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=restorus-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0465007856">James Q. Wilson's mind</a>), such a report suggests that someone high up in the CDC is engaged in a serious fight with someone in law enforcement. This is a direct shot at somebody with a vested interest in the current process that law enforcement uses to fight the drug war.

The other results were less controversial. Gang homicides are more likely to involve young adults, non-whites, males, and firearms. They are more likely to take place on weekends and be the result of drive-by shootings. In other words, nothing new - except the notable sobriety of the involved parties.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Faith in the Results of Forensic Science</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Our culture's lack of moral grounding has many consequences. One is how we treat uncertainty in criminal law, which has led to a blind obedience to the power of the confession and forensic science.

DNA and fingerprint evidence are largely considered solid evidence in most modern courts of law. The presence of one or both is usually enough to secure a conviction. Dr. Itiel Dror, a cognitive psycholgist at University College in London challenges us to consider an alternative. He has looked at DNA examiners' interpretations of results and found there to be a strong bias in some complex cases. In 2009, America's National Academy of Sciences used Dr. Dror's previous work to point out that the claim of zero error rates in fingerprint cases was scientifically impossible.

Quite recently, Dr. Dror and Dr. Greg Hampikian, a forensic biologist at Boise State University have published a study in Science &amp; Justice that reiterates the claim that DNA evidence may not be infallible. The two doctors gave DNA evidence from a real case to 17 DNA examiners in a government laboratory in the United States. The case was from a gang rape in Georgia in which one man testified against two others in exchange for a lighter sentence, even though all three denied any involvement. Original case investigators said that DNA indicated that one of the three was involved.

The original case workers knew the details of the case and knew that their tests were crucial to the outcome since Georgia requires evidence before a plea bargain is considered valid. However the researchers in the doctors' experiment knew nothing about the case details. Four couldn't say one way or the other if any of the three were involved. Twelve thought that the accused should be excluded. Only one said that the evidence supported involvement.

Dr. Dror and Dr. Hampikian suspect that the difference in prior knowledge skewed the results in the original case. Dr. Dror suggests that DNA evidence in approximately 25% of cases can be ambiguous due to tiny sampling or mixing material from more than one person. Cognitive bias appears to be a factor in forensic examinations, contributing to the perception that forensics is an infallible science.

It's very easy to crave certainty when something tragic happens, especially when one is aware of the tragedy. It's easy for this natural instinct for solid ground in a human dilemna to consciously or unconciously manifest itself as faith in the ability to find that certainty. The classics were able to accept uncertainty as inevitable; we, on the other hand, have been brought up to believe that we can find solid answers in science.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Truth Slips Out About Egypt</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The Arab Spring has sprung, but it seems that the United States suffers from severe allergies. Conditions in Egypt aren't as joyful as previously anticipated. The empire is peeved.

The Muslim Brotherhood continues to make advances in the new Egyptian democracy. There's nothing particularly shocking about this; a majority of Egyptians are Muslim and democracy wouldn't be genuine if the new government didn't reflect the will of the majority. In addition to violence against Coptic Christian minorities, the Egyptian government has quite recently decided to prosecute 43 pro-democracy activists, 19 of which are Americans. It would seem that, in addition to being Muslim, a majority of Egyptians are also probably anti-democratic.

The accused are said to have stirred up trouble in Egypt by funding non-governmental organizations. The US State Department has spoken out against the decision to prosecute and three American Senators (John McMcain, Kelly Ayotte, and Joe Lieberman) have said that the Egyptian government has needlessly raised tension to "advance a narrow political agenda."

The Beltway currently provides Egypt with $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic assistance each year. The Senators have said that the bribes are in jeopardy if Egypt continues such actions. The Senators say that the group accused have "done nothing wrong" and that "Their only assignment is to support Egypt in its transition to democracy."

Creepy words, coming from a country that previously has maintained that the Egyptian uprisings were spontaneous outbursts from a repressed public.

In December, Egyptian prosecutors raided offices of the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, which are front groups aligned with the Republican and Democratic parties respectively. The press say that the raids were attacks on free speech and attempts to silence ongoing protests.

An Egyptian delegation abruptly cancelled meetings with the American Senators shortly before they made their comments.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Another Rick Santorum Scandal</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: I am considered a radical by many because I believe that people should match their actions with their beliefs. Though I find fault with many politicians, there is special contempt for Rick Santorum. Perhaps there are many reasons we should dislike the man, but one particularly bothers me.

Rick Santorum has had a few scandals, not the least of which has been his stance on homosexuality that has led to an interesting Google problem (if you type "Santorum" into the search box on Google, you'll see what I mean). However, the newest Rick Santorum scandal is something quite old.

The scandal is simple: Santorum is a hypocrite. Perhaps all politicians are, in a way. Some (they call themselves "realists") say that it's the reality of the job; I would suggest that any job that requires hypocrisy is a job not worth having. Santorum's hypocrisy shines brilliantly on the issue of tort reform.

Mr. Santorum has a long career of fighting "frivilous" lawsuits where people sue for outrageous sums of money in court for injuries. Tort reform, which is often a proposal to cap the money that can be won from damages, has been a popular policy of the Republican Party for several years. It touches on two key tenets of the party. First, that government shouldn't impede the free market. The argument is that frivilous lawsuits bankrupt many small businesses because they're forced to pay incredible sums of money for events that are often outside their control. Second, people should take personal responsibility for their actions. Here, the argument is that the people suing for damages took a certain level of risk when they were undertaking a particular action. By suing for large sums of money, the people who undertook that risk are shifting blame to the doctors or the businesses that they freely selected instead of acknowledging that they chose wrong. A free market purist is likely to maintain that doctors who butcher their patients will go out of business on their own because people will hear about the butchery and stop going to them. The doctor will do something else, like cut meat, instead of being bankrupted under the current system.

The reason I would suggest that there's another Rick Santorum scandal is because in 1996, his wife was permanently injured by a chiropractor. Karen Santorum sued for damages in Virginia and won a sum of $350,000 in 1999. During the proceedings, Rick Santorum refused to make any public comment. His said that, "The court proceedings are a personal family matter. I will not be offering any further public comments, other than that I am not a party to the suit. But I am fully supportive of my wife." One may of course respect a husband for standing by his wife, but not a politician who feels that lawsuits are only frivilous when a family member isn't part of them.

Mrs. Santorum's Pittsburgh attorney, Heather Heidelbaugh, originally sought $500,000 in damages against Dr. David Dolberg of Virginia. Heidelbaugh said afterwards that Mrs. Santorum was vindicated by the outcome of the case.

Further, for the conspiratorially minded, the case directly links the Santorum family with friends of the Obama administration. Heather Heidelbaugh was with the Pittsburgh law firm Burns, White &amp; Hickton. Today, the firm is just called Burns White because David Hickton, one of the senior partners, was tapped by President Obama to be the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

As the good Lord said, one should remove the beam from their own eye before trying to remove the speck from your brother's eye. The Republican Party may want to remember this before they nominate a candidate who is merely the lesser of two evils.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Russian Protests Show No Signs of Going Away</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Russian protests are continuing on, despite some appeasement from the government and the cold of winter. One thing is certain: the number of protesters is too high to arrest them all.

The Russian protests are a self admitted futility. The demonstrators know that they have little chance in defeating Vladimir Putin in the March presidential election, but they have taken to the streets in an attempt to be heard. Prior to these demonstrations, the police have been fairly quick in breaking up opposition groups. But the size of the Russian protests has grown beyond the point of that kind of control. Nevertheless, they aren't large enough to make any real difference.

[caption id="attachment_294" align="alignleft" width="225"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-294" alt="hcordeiro, Flickr. " src="http://restorus.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/russian-kremlin-225x300.png" width="225" height="300" /> hcordeiro, Flickr.[/caption]

Demonstrators say that they are tired of corruption in the government, yet there seems to be more to it than that. <a href="http://english.ruvr.ru/2012/02/11/65870589.html">This interview</a> with Vyacheslav Nikonov, President of the Politika Foundation and the grandson of Josef Stalin's foreign minister, is particularly insightful in understanding the development of the Russian protests. He says that the distance between left and right is far greater in Russia than in any other European country. The nation is far from unified - various elements of the far left and right are active and outspoken.

Nikonov points out that the Putin government has been in power for twelve years; there are bound to be people who are unhappy or left out of the structure. He asks us to consider the fact that the Russian protests also include a number of people who are rallying for the government. Nikonov points out three groups of protesters. The first is the liberal, pro-Western sect which is unhappy with Putin and would like to see more Western policies. The second iis the communist group, which claims that Putin has been too Western. One of the leaders, Eduard Limonov, says that if this group has their way, the March election will be the last in Russian history because he'll institute a proletarian dictatorship. The third group is composed of nationalists who feel that the government is spending too much money supporting the Northern Caucasus and that there are too many Muslims migrating to Moscow.

It's too soon to tell in the Russian protests will deligitimize Putin or not. On one hand, they could because there are a large number of grievances coming from different corners. On the other, they could strengthen his position because he's seen as the most stable and least radical leader in Russia right now. The opposition groups have their own problems and aren't terribly popular with people; Putin may be able to position himself as a sane alternative.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: John McCain has been hailed as one of the most sensible and moderate politicians in Congress. His recent statements about Syria demonstrate that Congress, public opinion, and the so-called center are irredeemable.

Arizona Senator John McCain called on the United States to aid Syrian rebels in their quest to overthrow President Bashar Assad's government. "Right now we should be finding ways to help the people who are being slaughtered as we speak," the senator said on CNN. "The massacre goes on, artillery shilling - there's no legitimacy left in the Assad regime. So we can work with other countries to provide assistance in a broad variety of ways."

Syria has been in turmoil for months as protesters attempt to overthrow the Assad regime while the incumbent government struggles to retain power. McCain says that the United States should do something to help the rebels, suggesting that such aid can come in the form of weapons, military equipment, or communication gear. The White House says that it won't rule out such assistance. Press secretary Jay Carney said on Wednesday that they would prefer a political solution, but would do what they must to help the Syrian people "transition to democracy."

This past Friday, two suicide bombers exploded themselves at security compounds in Aleppo, killing 28. The attack struck an industrial center that has largely stood by Assad. The blasts tore through the headquarters of the Military Intelligence Directorate and a barracks for the Security Preservation forces. Captain Ammar al-Wawi of the Free Syrian Army denied involvement. His fighters were engaged in a firefight with government troops several hundred yards from the Directorate just an hour before.

I take the opinion of <a href="http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/021662.html">Lawrence Auster and Daniel S</a> who suggest that the rebels were in fact behind the attack. The fact that the rebels were engaged in a gun fight discredits the Western press' and politicians' story of a defenseless Syrian public (as both sides have guns). Further, the West recently supported Libyan rebels in their efforts to topple their government, despite the glaring fact that the rebels were recruiting child soldiers to participate in the uprisings.]]></content:encoded>

<b>SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: We have likely reached the point of no return for the American family. More women under 30 are giving birth to children outside of marriage than not.</b>

The New York Times touts it as the "new normal." For the first time, more than half of the women in the United States under 30 are having children born outside of marriage. Child Trends, a Washington-based research group analyzed government data and found that the fastest growth in out-of-wedlock births has occurred among white women in their 20s who have some college education, but no four-year degree.

59% of mothers of all ages were married when they had children according to 2009 data. But there has been a very large surge of young mothers having children born outside of marriage. Close to 70% of children born in the United States are born to women under 30. The surge of children born outside of marriage to mothers under 30 marks a very stark decline in American society.

Marriage has effectively been ruined. The social atomization caused by the influence of hedonistic ideologies is creating a generation of people who float through a series of relationships that lack any real commitment. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/us/for-women-under-30-most-births-occur-outside-marriage.html">The Times suggests that the root problem is a lack of education</a>, but researchers have long ago pointed out that higher education is correlated with lower birthrates overall.

Children are being adversely impacted. Researchers have consistently demonstrated that children born outside of marriage are more likely to be poor, fail out of school, and suffer behavioral problems.

The trend is clear. The lower class in America are continuing to have children born outside of marriage. The upper class are continuing to have fewer and fewer children. The future is one full of a small group of rich, stable people educated in progressive schools and a mass of poor people kept out of stable, public life.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Constitutional Claims About Social Conservatism</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Rick Santorum has gained popularity for allegedly being a "social conservative." Santorum claims that the American Constitution should be read "in the context of" the Declaration of Independence. Is this a legitimately right wing stance, or is it another instance of Republican schizophrenia?

<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/02/constitutional-claims">The Economist</a> recently covered this issue and argued that the Declaration's comment on the source of rights (God) is a separate issue from the status of those rights (unalienable) and that these two statements stand in slight contradiction to the Constitution which grants a separate set of rights. To summarize, according to the Founders some rights come from God and others from the Constitution.

I see two deeper issues at stake with Santorum's argument.

First, Rick Santorum is calling for the reinstatement of a revolutionary document. Most American ideologies claim some representation from the Founders, but none call for the reinstatement of the Articles of Confederation. It's widely accepted that the Articles were voided out by the Constitution because the Articles were too anarchic for practical, long-term use. It's odd then that the Declaration of Independence, which calls for the overthrow of governmental control, would not equally be shelved. Once the Revolution was over, there was no need to topple the state since the revolutionaries were the state. Unless Santorum and others want to argue for a perpetual revolution, which is a rather Marxist concept, they ought to acknowledge that the intent behind the Declaration cannot be in effect today.

Second, and perhaps I suggest this with <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/18/santorum-says-obama-agenda-not-based-on-bible_n_1286649.html">some irony</a>, Santorum's belief is not Biblically based. I would argue that our rights come from God and that all such rights, duties, and obligations are spelled out quite clearly in Holy Scripture. I would further contend, perhaps to the disagreement of some readers, that Holy Scripture is the final and absolute authority on these rights, duties, and obligations. What people say about these issues is of secondary importance, and in fact may not matter that much. If it isn't in the Bible, it isn't Biblical; Christ lives, while Jefferson is dead.

Inflamatory words, no doubt, but that's not to say that we reject the Founders; it merely means that we reject any argument that isn't found in Scripture - whether it be from the Founders or anyone else.

I have argued that American politics is fundamentally schizophrenic; in other words, it is filled with various contradictions that masquerade as consistent positions. I have also argued that the left has been largely successful in destabalizing and destroying all sense of tradition. While it may once have been prudent to tolerate certain contradictions for the sake of societal stability (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_lie">Plato's noble lie</a>), tradition is dead and that stability is gone. The disadvantages to this state of affairs are numerous; crime, violence, degenerate behavior, disease, and an almost universal malady that pollutes and corrupts the soul. The one advantage, and the only hope that we have, is that we can at last do away with the mistakes and contradictions of the past and construct a post-liberal order.

Until Rick Santorum and other politicians have the courage to wade into the chaos, they will always remain servants to the current modern system.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Are Super PAC Contributions the Problem?</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Everyone seems in agreement that corporate influence in politics is bad. Tea Party Republicans are upset that Mitt Romney's political action committee (PAC) is able to outspend their favored candidates. Liberal Democrats say that Wall Street is silencing the voices of the poor. Libertarians suggest that if the government was smaller, super PAC's would contribute less. So why does everyone and their mother own a PAC?

Super PAC contributions are at an all time high. Campaign finance laws, first put in place in the 1970's, have limited how much money individuals and groups can give to American politicians. In most cases, donations were capped at $5,000 per election cycle. The laws were intended to eliminate fears of bribery while still allowing popular candidates to raise money.

Since a Supreme Court ruled in their favor in 2010, super PAC contributions have been growing because the groups are associated with particular issues instead of elections. The Supreme Court has ruled that super PAC contributions can be as large as desired, and that unions and businesses could participate so long as they remained independent of any particular candidate or party.

Independence has been a loose term of late. Candidates can raise money for PAC's and former campaign staff members are often seen running them.

There has been some mumbling in political corners to limit how much money PAC's can contribute to campaigns. As stated above, people from various points of view seem in agreement that corporate influence on politics is bad. Very few seem willing to give up their PAC's and fewer still have identified the real problem.

Libertarians, however, come close. They suggest that the government is too involved in economic affairs. As a result, there's a huge incentive for businesses, unions, and other interested parties to make large super PAC contributions to sway elections. Elections are life and death issues for certain groups, since different parties often cut or expand funding to particular groups when they make it into office. The libertarians are closest to the answer because they're the only group suggesting that political influence over economics is the real evil, not as others believe, the other way around.

The libertarian answer falls short in one respect. They criticize the government's involvement in economics for economic reasons; they say it disrupts the free exchange of goods, the division of labor, private property, etc. In other words, they are operating from a position that believes that there is too little economic reasoning in politics, not too much.

We must always remember that classical liberal America birthed modern liberal America. There is no escaping this historical reality. Our task is to identify what elements of classical liberal America led to the crisis we're in now. It would seem that using economic reasoning in politics is part of the problem. Economics is the science of household management (that's what the word originally meant). It is a fundamentally self-interested science; when it's used in a sphere previously dedicated to the common good, it turns previously altruistic actors into self-interested actors. The over-regulation of America, the large super PAC contributions, the fears about bribery, and even libertarians are all a symptom of a society that has lost sight of its common good.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Climate in Iraq Was More Extreme in Ancient Times</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Archaeologists and historians have found ancient texts composed between 816 and 1009 AD in Iraq. Researchers published an analysis in Weather of the various writings done by scholars, historians, and diarists who lived during the Islamic Golden Age.

<i>The team found that the climate in Iraq likely experienced greater extremes than they do today. The writings document significant climate events such as severe cold weather that are rare in present time.</i>

"Climate information recovered from these ancient sources mainly refers to extreme events which impacted wider society such as droughts and floods," said the primary author, Dr. Fernando Dominguez-Castro. "However, they also document conditions which were rarely experienced in ancient Baghdad such as hailstorms, the freezing of rivers or even cases of snow."

In 891, Baghdad was considered a city without rival that had hot summers and cold winters, making the climate in Iraq perfect for strong agriculture. Even Herodotus tells us that the size of grain crops in Mesopotamia were larger and more plentiful than anywhere else in the world. The writers documented a number of cold events in the first parts of the 10th century. There were significant temperature drops during July 920 AD, snowfall in 908, 944, and 1007 - compared to the only record of snow in modern Baghdad in 2008.

The published study focuses primarily on Iraq, but it clearly has implications for the rest of the era. Dominguez-Castro says that "Ancient Arabic documentary sources are a very useful tool for finding eye witness descriptions which support the theories made by climate models" and that "The ability to reconstruct past climates provides us with useful historical context for understanding our own climate. We hope this potential will encourage Arabic historians and climatologists to work together to increase the climate data rescue from across the Islamic world."

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In a policy manifesto published yesterday in the Russian state-owned Moskovskiye Novosti, Vladimir Putin lashes out at American foreign policy ambitions. This comes in contrast to efforts made by President Obama to improve relations with the former Cold War adversary.

The stance made by Putin is nothing new. He and other Russian politicians have long derided a score of US foreign policy goals. Namely, the Russians are opposed to American efforts at democracy-promotion in the Middle East, the repeated attempts to install an anti-missile shield in eastern Europe, and any strengthening of ties between the Americans and China.

Putin and Obama will likely have more than a few issues to work out if (when) the former wins his upcoming election and reassumes control at the Kremlin. Putin wrote, "It seems that NATO countries, and especially the United States, have developed a peculiar understanding of security which is fundamentally different from our view. The Americans are obsessed with the idea of securing absolute invulnerability for themselves, which, incidentally, is a utopia, for both technological and geopolitical reasons. But that is exactly where the root of the problem lies…. Absolute invulnerability for one nation would mean absolute vulnerability for everybody else."

Dmitry Suslov, a researcher at the leading Moscow think tank, the Council on Foreign and Defense Policies, says that Putin feels that America is to blame for many of the world's problems and that "Russia must prepare itself to act as a counterbalance to the US."

Russian opposition to intervention in the Middle East is nothing new; since at least the 1960's they have fought a number of proxy battles and Russia has always used its veto power in the United Nations to block any attempts at armed multilateral intervention. The Russians have also been historically very weary of any military build up or defense positioning in eastern Europe. The areas around Poland and other Slavic countries have traditionally been viewed as Russia's buffer between it and western Europe. With a missile defense shield in Poland, a pro-America China, and a hostile United States, it's easy to see how Russia might feel surrounded.

Whether Russia is able to act as a real counterbalance to American ambition remains to be seen.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Biblical Meaning of Numbers</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: People have long searched the Scripture for deeper meaning. One somewhat neglected area of study has been the Biblical meaning of numbers. If each word in the Bible is the direct revelation of God, then each word must have significance and meaning for the believer. As a result, there must be a Biblical meaning behind what numbers are used since there are no coincidences or mistakes with God.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Below is a table that describes the Biblical meaning of numbers as I have found them in the Scripture. You are encouraged to do your own research to determine if the numerology and meanings are correct, or if they have any relevance to your understanding of the word. Before I present the full table, there is some justification behind a few of the numbers.

&nbsp;

For instance, I claim that the number one denotes unity and new beginnings. We can see this with the first and only begotten Son, the first light, the first day, and so forth.

&nbsp;

The number two can actually mean union or division, depending on its context. We see the Biblical requirement for two witnesses before condemning someone to death, the like example of the two witnesses in Revelation, but also we see phrases such as "double minded" and having a "double heart" which imply division.

&nbsp;

I claim that the number three has a spiritual meaning of divine completeness and perfection, as exemplified through the Trinity.

&nbsp;

The Biblical meaning of number four is the Creation and the world. We see this with references to the four winds, the four corners, the four seasons, and so on.

&nbsp;

Five is generally grace, which first manifests itself in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) which serves as God's story of delivering the people into the promised land through his grace. Five is also the leading figure in the numbers given for the tabernacle measurements.

&nbsp;

Six denotes man. Man was created on the sixth day, he works six days out of the week, his day is a multiple of six, and all men who stand against God are emphatically marked by six.

&nbsp;

The meaning of seven is spiritual perfection. Seven regulates the periods of gestation and incubation for animals, humans, birds, and insects. There are seven trumps, seven seals, seven vials, and 7,000 who were chosen of God.

&nbsp;

Eight is a new beginning. The eighth is a new first, as seen in music, colors, days of the week, and the first day after the Lord's rest.

&nbsp;

Nine denotes judgment, or spiritual fruit (the end result, the evaluation of the final product). It is 3 x 3, or the result of divine completeness. The number nine or related numbers are seen in all instances where judgment is the subject.

&nbsp;

Ten represents the testimony and the law; there are ten commandments we all must follow and when ten is used, it is generally alongside a subject of finality.

&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In this series, we examine Nazi mysticism and the failure of non-mythical politics. By examining the Nazi myth seriously, we can gain insight into how such an insane ideology could so soundly defeat liberal opponents at home. The thrust of the argument is that secular liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics.

The defeat of Nazi Germany has become a thing of legend.  Rhetoric surrounding Nazism has remained fairly constant over the years; in popular books published since the war, Nazis are the epitome of evil, they are crazy and fanatical people, they are strange creatures of darkness that murdered several million innocent people.  If there is evil in the world, it was embodied by Adolf Hitler.  Yet the distance that the current generation has from the events of the 1940's is vast; the ability of our generation, perhaps more than previous eras, to understand what happened is clouded.  Why?  We were not there and the only access most people have to knowledge about that time comes from television and movies.  Individual writers have warned against the danger of fascism.  These warnings deserve our attention only if it can be demonstrated that fascism could occur again.  This study argues that it can since liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics.

This will be proved in the following way: first, I will look at why this issue and Nazi mysticism are important and how they can be addressed; second, I will define major terms; third, I will investigate Nazi mysticism and its appeal; fourth, I will uncover why liberal democracy could not survive in Germany; and finally, this paper will spend a moment to discuss the future prospects of mythical politics.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Nazi Mysticism: Justification &amp; Methodology</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/politics/nazi-mysticism-justification-methodology</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In this section, I justify the scope of the study and explain my method.

If I demonstrate that fascism could rise again, the current order will be forced to deal with the consequences.  The destruction caused by Nazism goes without saying.  Over 12 million people were systematically organized and exterminated in death camps across Europe.  Thousands of individuals participated in this process, most of them ordinary and not particularly malicious.  The movement headed by Adolf Hitler declared war on most of the world and there were times when it looked as though Germany would be victorious (Mearsheimer 2001).  A modern society that had grown up in the bosom of Europe's intellectual culture of Enlightenment reason, turned homicidal and genocidal almost overnight.  If the development of fascism was an anomaly, then we have nothing to fear; Hitler is dead, fascism is gone.  If, however, was something that resulted from that intellectual culture or something immune to normal politics, then we may yet again become fascists or find ourselves unable to defeat fascists in our own society.  Should some be correct when they suggest "there are some men who simply want to watch the world burn" then we owe it to the victims of the Holocaust to address the causes of fascism; there are new and more horrific ways to burn the world to the ground.

It would be a mistake to approach this as many previous writers have done and treat Nazis as simply "crazies."  The fanaticism of Nazi thought has been legendary among contemporaries.  Instead, we should take the approach of writers like James Rhodes.  Rhodes suggests that we understand Nazis as they understood themselves, since this is the only way to reach any kind of comprehension about the motives of individuals within the movement. (Rhodes 1980, Preface)  If we approach the Nazis strictly from the outside, we will already conclude that the rise of fascism was an anomaly from the start.  This paper would become superfluous.  If we approach their views as they understood them, this will allow us to understand the movement; if the popular view is correct and the Nazis were simply insane, there will be no order to their thoughts.  To do otherwise risks a dogmatic approach that overlooks the appeal that mythical politics holds.  It is easy for intellectuals to look down on people's "superstitions" as being stupid, but these approaches do nothing to prevent individuals from joining "superstitious" movements and groups.  In order to defeat an argument, it is necessary to understand it.

A similar approach should be taken when dealing with points of view that we relate to.  We must avoid dogmatism, since it over-simplifies arguments and hides the truth.  As John Stuart Mill, one of the classical liberal thinkers, states, "the only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind." (Mill 1859, 25)  Our investigation must deeply and seriously consider the intricacies of liberal theory.  If the argument of this paper, that liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics, is correct then defenders of liberalism will eventually be forced to reconcile their doctrine with this political reality.  In order for this to take place, defenders of liberalism will have to engage in a serious consideration of any potential weaknesses.

Those of us who have benefited from liberalism's guarantees of free speech and other liberties cannot fall into the trap of dogmatic allegiance to the status quo.  In this investigation, we should look primarily to authors outside of Germany.  This is not to discount the contribution of parliamentarians in Germany to liberal thought, but it is an attempt to form general opinions about liberalism.  Kelsen, Weber, and others wrote in the intellectual climate of Germany at the time of its transformation to Nazism, and their writings may well be important in looking at the rise of Nazism specifically against the liberalism of Weimar, but their writings all operate on the general assumptions that liberalism has. (Kennedy 1985, xvii) However, this study is concerned with liberalism generally and its ability to withstand mythical politics generally.

The Nazi myth and the German liberals are simply a case study.  It is, nevertheless, an important case study since the Nazis were decisively anti-liberal; they openly campaigned against the goals of liberal democracy.  Unlike Marxism, which had tacitly accepted the legitimacy of democracy, the Nazis could in no way be characterized as liberal.  That is not to say that people have tried, such as the recent attempt by Jonah Goldberg. (Goldberg 2007)  Yet Goldberg is mainly arguing that the Nazis opposed Enlightenment virtues, much like, as he claims, the Democratic Party does in the United States.  Goldberg's claim that Nazi opposition to the Enlightenment made the fascists liberals merely highlights the need for some clarity about the Nazi movement.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Nazi Mysticism: Definitions</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/politics/nazi-mysticism-definitions</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In part three, I define some key terms.

In order to argue that liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics, we need to define each of these terms.

Liberalism is understood as a set of political assumptions that place an emphasis on individual rights and a commitment to be "value-free."  These individual rights include free speech, free religion, free press, the right to peacefully assemble, and the right to property.  The political organization of a society is established in order to guarantee these rights.  Liberal government will institute a series of checks and balances, which is to say a division of sovereignty into different micro-sections in order to prevent any one individual or group from holding too much power.  Liberal government will typically promote free markets, which is to say a general "hands-off" policy when it comes to managing the economy or, depending on the circumstances, intervention in the market only if it can be demonstrated that this intervention will better attain liberal goals.  Liberalism's stance toward ethics is related to its insistence on individual rights.  Liberal thinkers offer no judgment of individual conduct since each individual has the right to choose their lifestyle without any interference from others, meaning that ethical decisions, religion, political views, etc. are all in the realm of private opinion.

Survival can be misunderstood.  By this word, we do not mean that liberalism will cease to exist everywhere once a mythical politics comes into being.  Instead, we can define survival as being the ability of liberalism to function in a society.  In a closed, geographic location (such as within the borders of Germany), when liberalism stands alongside mythical politics, this essay argues that liberalism will not be able to function for very long.  The mythical politics will eventually take over the apparatus of government (through armed revolution or peaceful elections) and negate the framework under which liberalism functions in order to fulfill its mythology.  This requires an analogy.

Let us assume a parliament with five respective parties: four of which want to preserve the liberal democracy, and one of which is a party similar to the Nazis (in that it is loyal to an ideology that is not rooted in human reason but a larger ideal that stands outside of it).  While the parliament stands and democratic competition takes place, a free speech is allowed to everyone, liberalism functions.  As soon as the mythical party gains a constitutional-changing majority, and proceeds to institute its myth, liberalism ceases to function.  Particular parties are generally barred from office, new methods of ruler selection are instituted, and the end of government changes from a simple preservation of individual rights into whatever supreme good is advocated for by the myth.

This brings us, naturally, to the definition of conflict.  We do not necessarily mean violent clashes, though political conflict can consist of this.  We mean instead the opposition of two mutually exclusive political ideologies that can manifest itself through electoral competition or violent exchanges.  When liberalism, which advocates free markets and individual rights, stands in opposition to a ideology such as communism, which advocates public ownership of the means of production, these two forces are in conflict.  One cannot have both communism and liberalism, just as one cannot have Nazism and communism or Nazism and liberalism since the basic assumptions of each call into question the validity of the other's method at attaining knowledge.  The communist will not view the liberal's claim to justice as worthy of consideration because the communist assumption is that liberal ideology is just a manifestation of class ideals; the communist will view the liberal as an enemy other to be combated in order to bring about the communist ideal rather than a competing opinion that deserves fair and open consideration.  They may exist as simultaneous groups, they might even meet in the same parliament building for a time, but individuals cannot be both liberals and communists.  There may be intermediate compromises between the two in a practical setting (perhaps even in the same mind) but when either is pushed to the extreme, a choice must be made.

Mythical politics are politics that aim to serve a supernatural force.  This can be a god, a world spirit, History, or racial instincts.  Any number of things can be considered a supernatural force by participants in mythical politics.  Under a mythical framework, the end of political society is the benefit or dictate of this force.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Nazi Mysticism: The Nazi Myth &amp; Its Appeal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In this section, I examine the Nazi myth in order to see what qualities are common to ideologies that retain allegiance to supernatural or other forces that do not fit within the scope of human reason.

The Nazi movement was a mythical movement in that its members saw themselves as a chosen few destined to fight primordial forces of evil in a conflict to end all conflicts, the completion of which would usher in a golden age.  James Rhodes provides excellent analysis of the nature of National Socialist myths.  He proposes, along the same lines of Eric Voegelin, that the Nazis were a millenarian movement.  This is to say that the Nazis believed that they lived at a crucial point in history at which the end of the world was at hand and that something drastic must be done before the forces of evil gained the final victory.  Rhodes lays out six characteristic beliefs of millenarian movements; we can follow them in our analysis. (Rhodes 1980, 29-30)  A demonstration that the Nazis meet Rhodes' criteria would show that the Nazis meet our definition of mythical politics.  Some analysis from other sources is provided to further demonstrate the appeal of mythical politics.

<b>Disaster Syndrome</b>

According to Rhodes, major figures in the National Socialist Party experienced feelings of incredible disorientation. (Rhodes 1980, 30)  He documents how Hitler described the state of Germany after World War I as being in a "time of bewilderment."  Rosenberg felt that the entirety of society was "confused to the point of insanity." (Rhodes 1980, 31)  Hitler and others spoke continually of the "perishing" and "annihilation" of German society.  The Versailles Treaty and the growth of Marxism were all signs that the German people faced an imminent and permanent enslavement.

This peculiar disaster syndrome was not unique to major party figures.  Even mid-level bureaucrats experienced a kind of senselessness before joining the party.  The effect of this feeling was isolation; once individuals joined the party, they were subject to the logic and rules of the party.  Outside of the movement was chaos, but within it was a new morality and science.  This is why Victor Klemperer could write with such horror about the modification in language that occurred in the Third Reich.

His report shows how words such as "fanatic" were redefined by Nazi propagandists and how the German language was given new articles and prefixes.  (Klemperer 1947)  We see here something more than just totalitarian redefinition, but the introduction of a new logic.  Amos Elon can write in his introduction to Arendt's work, "The Nazis [made] the wrong and the malevolent the foundation of a new righteousness" because the Nazis were successful in establishing a group morality that differed so completely with the rest of the world.  Once an individual found themselves completely disoriented by society, they were susceptible to moralities that the rest of society would condemn, and as a result, actions that they would not have done in their previous states.

<b>Sudden Revelations</b>

Once an individual suffers from the disaster syndrome, Rhodes contends that they are at risk to experience sudden revelations about their condition. (Rhodes 1980, 29)  These revelations will explain their suffering and point toward a path of salvation.  Rhodes shows us that Nazi members felt driven by a spirit that called to members through blood. (Rhodes 1980, 40)  Goering, Hitler, and others were driven by what Gregor Strasser called the "one 'correct' spirit; that is the spirit that is from man, from the image of God, from Nature eternally endowed with soul." (Rhodes 1980, 40)  This stood in opposition to reason, which is to say solely human attempts at knowledge about the world.  As the Nazi leader Strasser claimed, "rational thought corrodes the foundations of life itself." (Rhodes 1980, 41)

Some have argued that the Nazis were simply peddling these mystical beliefs in order to recruit popular support.  This is the particular argument advanced by Hermann Rauschning, a former Nazi.  He contended that Nazi rulers did not believe in anything at all and that it is this quality that made them so dangerous since theirs was a program of destruction only.  At least the communists, in Rauschning's view, were trying to create some sort of society.  Rauschning writes that the Nazi movement was revolutionary in scope in that it sought a complete change in the way politics was carried out, and that:

"The revolutionary dictatorship is a new type, in its cynical, unprincipled policy of violence. The outsider overlooks above all the essential distinction between the mass and the élite in the new revolutions.  This distinction is vital in every field.  That which is intended for the mass is not applicable to the élite.  Program and official philosophy, allegiance and faith, are for the mass.  Nothing commits the élite – no philosophy, no ethical standard." (Rauschning 1939, 20)

According to Rauschning, the recognition that the Nazi leaders were cynically exploiting people's ability to believe mystical ideas is key for understanding developments within Germany at the time.  There are two flaws, however, with Rauschning's thesis.

First, if we are to assume that the leaders were pure nihilists then we are still left with a population that believes what these nihilists produce.  In a word, the myths that they believe or their tendency to believe in myths mean that this paper is of political relevance and its overall point might be true since in order for a lie to work, someone has to believe it.  The assumption that Nazi leaders were cool-headedly exploiting the ignorant masses assumes that they viewed their ideology in the way that most social scientists do, which gives the Nazis unrealistic qualities (such as lacking any emotion and being social geniuses) and perhaps paints a disturbing picture of social scientists.  The thesis still leaves room for the proposition that liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics.

Second, Rauschning's thesis ignores the behavior of the movement itself.  Nazism, as Rhodes shows us, really attempted to create a racially pure state that would carry out a final conflict with what it viewed to be the forces of evil.  Nazi leaders devoted resources to killing Jews that would have been better served fighting the war.   This fact implies that the Nazis were in fact concerned about ideology, since the cool-headed view would focus on winning the war first so that more Jews could be killed later.  Nothing except ideology can account for mid-war trade-offs between genocide and troop transport. (Neiman 2009, 264)  When the Nazis started losing the war, they increased the rate of killing in the camps instead of allowing the train tracks and soldiers to be utilized on the eastern front.

Liberalism, however, does not rely on sudden revelation to win over supporters.  Instead, liberalism is accepted as a part of maturity in societies that is usually aided through education. (Kant)  People learn to be free through a discussion of ideas that allows the truth to be heard.  The assumption here is that people will come to the truth if they hear it because everybody has equal access to the faculties of reason.  Under the Nazi paradigm, only the chosen could come to the truth, and they came to it through intuition and not reason.

<b>The First Principles of Evil</b>

The revelations experienced by Nazis pointed to the first principles of evil.  This first principle of evil was the Jew.  Average Nazis declared Jews to be "the originators of all the evils." (Rhodes 1980, 45)  Goebbels called them "incarnate devils" while the socialist wing of the party complained that "Jewish capitalists" were responsible for economic misery.  It is perhaps too easy to quote instances of Nazi anti-Semitism, but it is important to note that Nazis viewed Jews as instinctually driven to destroy Germany specifically and humanity generally.  Hitler himself believed that Jews were biologically demonic and took on the form of humans only over the course of centuries.

Rhodes points to an analogy in the Book of Revelation.  He states, "Whereas Satan had raised up 'beasts' to kill and oppress the Christians, the Jew had created 'the system' to crush the Germans.  This monster was an elaborate network of institutions and movements which secretly helped 'the great destroyer of peoples' do his work." (Rhodes 1980, 46)  All of these movements were directed by a fiendish "Jewish international finance capitalist."  This one individual, who was nameless and in the shadows, organized the suffering of others to benefit his own greed.  Elite and average Nazis believed in the existence of this mastermind.  Jews ran the media, the banks, Marxist groups, department stores, and the stock exchanges.  All of the tentacles of evil had their roots in Judaism which explained the drive to destroy it.  The introduction of the concept of evil infused Jews with a quality that was beyond the scope of traditional politics; there was a mythical, eschatological quality to the struggle with Judaism.

Some would argue that this was only the face the Nazis showed the public.  The SS was certainly less enthusiastic about the myth.  Arendt reports that "By its 'objectivity' (Sachlichkeit), the S.S. dissociated itself from such 'emotional' types as Streicher, that 'unrealistic fool,' and also from certain 'Teutonic-Germanic Party bigwigs who behaved as though they were clad in horns and pelts.'" (Arendt 1963, 69)  She does go on to say that Himmler, who was head of the SS, allowed himself to be "influenced by it" for a long time.

Arendt's study is brilliant in demonstrating how the bureaucrats of the Third Reich rationalized and economized the genocide.  She shows how, "talking about concentration camps in terms of 'administration' and about extermination camps in terms of 'economy' – was typical of the S.S. mentality" and how Nazi bureaucrats working in the departments responsible for these activities were proud of their "objectivity." (Arendt 1963, 69)  The study of how such things could be done without emotion or malice is necessary and beneficial in understanding the nature of bureaucracy.  Arendt contributes to our understanding about how genocide can be carried out, but we are also interested in why the orders were given in the first place.  It may be that the average bureaucrat looked down on those who "behaved as though they were clad in horns and pelt" but they also were "influenced by it" and that influence is important.  Mass murder may be rationalized, but in order for it to happen there must be a reason for the order.  The reason for the order in this case is that the Jews were viewed as the first principles of evil.

<b>The Chosen Few</b>

Those who received the "call of the blood" thought that they were a chosen few.  Only a select portion of the population had been given the truth about the human condition.  It was these few that were charged with the sacred task to fight the forces of Jewry both at home and abroad.  The German Volk, which is to say common people, were those chosen.  Hitler claimed that "the Volk [...] is the seed of life from which a new tree some day will strike secure roots." (Rhodes 1980, 58)  Much like St. John in the Book of Revelation, Rhodes contends that the Nazis felt that the Volk would rise to victory in the midst of the worst oppression and distress.  In the writings of numerous Nazi leaders, the prediction that the miserable state of Germany would transform into joy was repeated.

Rhodes tells us, "The Nazis were certain of their eschatological views, their teleological ideas, and their election.  The human myth-making faculty had taught the Hitlerites that they could survive by magically annihilating demons.  To be credible, the myth-making capacity also had to tell them why they were in a situation that demanded sorcery.  It had to guarantee that if they performed the required rituals, they would not only live but be rewarded." (Rhodes 1980, 61)  Under a liberal paradigm, there were no demons to slay; superstition and the irrational were continually critiqued by thinkers committed to the use of reason.  If individuals would rationally think through their political arrangements, they would see that demonic forces were simply misunderstood and that a compromise could be reached between them.  What gave the Nazis such momentum was the fact that the average person was likely to side with the political ideology that offered a firm view of the world; when it comes down to a choice between understanding that each of us are human beings with individual and valid claims to rights versus a political view that allows one to participate in a crusade to rid the world of evil, people choose the crusade.

Even the "objective" SS was infected with a belief in its election.  Adolf Eichmann joined the movement because it gave his life meaning.  Arendt informs us of his perspective. "From a humdrum life without significance and consequence the wind had blown him into History, as he understood it, namely, into a Movement that always kept moving and in which someone like him – already a failure in the eyes of his social class, of his family, and hence in his own eyes as well – could start from scratch and still make a career." (Arendt 1969, 33)  Eichmann broke with Christianity during the Nazi period because "'a higher Bearer of Meaning,' an entity somehow identical with the 'movement of the universe,' to which human life, in itself devoid of 'higher meaning,' is subject" caught his attention (Arendt 1963, 27)  Arendt writes that "To call God a <i>Höheren Sinnesträger</i> [Higher Bearer of Meaning] meant linguistically to give him some place in the military hierarchy, since the Nazis had changed the military 'recipient of order,' the <i>Befehlsempfänger</i>, into a 'bearer of orders,' a <i>Befehlsträger</i>." (Arendt 1963, 27)  Eichmann may not have worn any pelts or horns but he worked as an SS officer for a reason.  He felt called, in his own way, to serve the Higher Bearer of Meaning in a destiny larger than himself.

The victory of the German Volk was not inevitable.  Nazi leaders felt themselves called to participate in an eschatological war, which is to say a conflict to end all conflicts, a final war.  This war was against the forces of Jewry.  "In this [...] powerful, great contest, there are only two possibilities: Either the victory of the Aryan side or its annihilation and the victory of the Jew." (Rhodes 1980, 64)
As a result, Hitler called for a messianic struggle against Judaism.  Through the Treaty of Versailles and other measures, Judaism was amassing for a final assault against the German people.  Hitler and the Nazis felt that it was necessary for a strike against Judaism before the situation collapsed.  In doing so, "Nazi leaders usurped the functions and identity of the warrior Jesus, replacing the divinely begotten Savior with the naturally gifted Leader." (Rhodes 1980, 68)  Hermann Rauschning, despite his belief that Nazi elites were cynical nihilists, discusses Hitler's messianic mission.  "The Messiah-figure of the leader is the indispensable center of their propaganda, as carefully devised as the whole of the apparatus of power." (Rauschning 1939, 35)

The Nazi regime portrayed Hitler as a messiah in order to cynically exploit the population's tendency to believe myth because "Our age [...] readily indulges from time to time in the awe of adventurers and visionaries." (Rauschning 1939, 36)  With "perfect sincerity and conviction" a Nazi colleague told Rauschning that "Only when Hitler had really become a mythical figure would the whole depth of his magical influence reveal itself." (Rauschning 1939, 36)  The main vessel for the revelation of this mysticism was the Nazi Party.  Through the Edda Society, the Thule Society, and other secretive orders that drew their symbolism from ancient Teutonic culture, party members could fellowship with other chosen people. (Goodrick-Clarke 1985) We can say in short that Nazis believed themselves to be called to serve Hitler, their messiah, in a final struggle against Jewish devils.

<b>On the Brink of Collapse</b>

Rhodes' fifth criteria is the belief that the side of the chosen is on the brink of collapse.  As alluded to previously, Germans felt themselves driven to participate in an eschatological war against Judaism.  This final conflict was necessary because the forces of Judaism were amassing for a final strike against the Aryan race.  In 1930, Rhodes tells us that Hitler and the Nazis massed for an eleventh hour counter-attack on Jewry.  He says that the myth of the immanence of the final struggle was perpetuated throughout the entire regime.  Each battle was fought against demonic elements and German leaders were constantly trying to waken a "sleeping Germany" to stand against its enemies. (Rhodes 1980, 68-69)

<b>The Golden Age</b>

Rhodes presents six criteria for a movement to be considered millenarian.  As we stated above, proving that the Nazis were also millenarian proves that they were an example of mythical politics.  We can tentatively say that millenarian movements are at least a subset of mythical politics; the Nazis may hold relation to communist movements that view themselves as the representatives of a final class conflict, to Islamic fundamentalists who see themselves entrenched in a crusade against infidel invaders, and to Christian groups preparing for an end-times battle with Satan, in that all groups claim allegiance to a larger than life order with world-historical implications.  As such, the Nazis can provide a case study for examining if liberalism can survive a conflict with mythical politics.  In Weimar Germany, it was a showdown between Hitler and the Republic and Hitler won.  In this analysis, we seek to understand if Hitler's victory was due to the strength of his myth.  We have shown that Nazism meets five of Rhodes' criteria.  The final criterion is the belief that the efforts of the chosen will result in the culmination of a golden age.

Rhodes again points us to the Book of Revelation where St. John discusses the advent of a New Jerusalem, which is to say the eternity in which God rules on earth over immortal beings.  Rhodes posits that the Nazis believe that their efforts will result in a golden age.  He says that, "For their part, the Nazis looked forward to 'a new better Third Reich,' 'the thousand-year Reich,' 'the new Reich,' 'the new Germany,' 'the Germany of the future,' 'a new creation,' 'the other time.'" (Rhodes 1980, 71-72)

Nazi efforts at eugenics have been well-researched (Eugenics Archive 2010).  Nazi eugenics were intended to breed a pure Aryan race that could rule in the future, a "higher humanity" of sorts.  Nazi rulers felt that the golden age would be populated with this higher humanity once the Nazis did the dirty work of fighting the eschatological conflict.  As Rhodes tells us, "The NSDAP itself would mold the saints who were to populate its paradise." (Rhodes 1980, 79)  The Nazi movement was called by the Higher Bearer of Being in order to create a new race to populate a golden age free of evil.  This is a succinct statement of the Nazi myth.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In this section, I discuss how liberalism failed to contend with such a powerful yet demonic ideology.

The modern reader will likely find such an account to be something out of a fairy tale.  It perhaps seems strange that everyday individuals would suddenly find themselves in the grip of a millenarian mania.  In our age, we look down on people who behave as though they wear pelts and horns.  We are tempted to call such people delusional, but we forget that our sober minds were unable to prevent the rise of such a group.  We have moved beyond the era of superstition, as we are told by the media and academics.  The Nazi movement received widespread support in the polls and with everyday people. (Heilbronner 1988)

Perhaps, as some might suggest, only idiots buy into the movement.  The leaders, echoing Rauschning, might really be more clear-headed than someone who sincerely believes themselves to be called to rid the world of the demons masking as humans who attend the synagogue down the street.  Hannah Arendt certainly demonstrated that Adolf Eichmann was not very intelligent, remarking once that "his inability to speak was closely connected with an inability to think." (Arendt 1963, 49)  Eichmann, far from being the evil genius who organized the Holocaust, was an idiot who parroted party slogans and catch-phrases that reflected a failure to think through his actions.

Such a view overlooks obviously intelligent people such as Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt, both of whom were university professors who joined the party.  We may write such instances off as being the result of opportunism or fears of repercussion, but a couple of these professors refused to undergo denazifaction (the program instituted by the Allied forces in order to prove that individuals did not have allegiance to Nazi ideals).  We are forced to face the fact that people actually believed it, and in light of that we need to investigate how liberalism failed to resist mythical politics.  There are two primary ways that liberalism failed: first, its insistence on absolute free speech allowed for the growth of mythical politics; and second, its abstinence from value judgments failed to address the moral questions that myth concerned itself with.

<b>Government by Discussion</b>

Liberalism's insistence on absolute free speech undermined its ability to resist mythical politics.  In order to understand this, we need to look at the role that free speech holds in the liberal framework.  As stated above, liberalism establishes a framework of individual rights meaning that it guarantees a plurality of liberties to members of the system.  We are singling free speech out for special consideration because free speech is particularly important to the assumptions of liberalism and because the ability for mythical movements and causes to rally support is severely aided by the freedom to disseminate views.  When enough people believe the myth, a fear of social ostracization prevents others from speaking out. (Tocqueville 1830)  The majority cows the others into silence and acceptance, made all the more likely and dangerous because most mythical movements (such as the Nazis) do not hold any allegiance to ideas about freedom of expression.

Free speech is central to liberalism.  One may even say that liberalism is government by discussion.  We mean by "discussion" the same definition Schmitt proposed, which is, "an exchange of opinion that is governed by the purpose of persuading one's opponent through argument of the truth or justice of something, or allowing oneself to be persuaded of something as true and just." (Schmitt 1926, 5)  In the writings of the classical liberals, such as Mill and Locke, discussion holds a very important role in determining truth.  Further, in the writings of modern liberals such as Mises and Hayek, free discussion is instrumental in attaining knowledge.  There is, in all of these writers, an unwavering faith in the ability of discussion to reach truth and justice.  This has been liberalism’s peculiar claim to legitimacy; it promises to be the best approximation of truth since it allows all opinions to be heard.

For Mill, freedom of discussion is centrally connected to the very essence of human liberty.  He writes, "This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty.  It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological." (Mill 1859, 15)  Free speech, for Mill, is the expression of opinion.  This opinion can only be formed in that "inward domain of consciousness" that resides in autonomous individuals.  The individual must be granted full range to explore any domain of thought, for "Strange it is, that men should admit the validity of the arguments for free discussion, but object to their being 'pushed to an extreme'; not seeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are not good for any case." (Mill 1859, 26)

It is inexcusable to silence any opinion since, "We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still." (Mill 1859, 21)  It is not just inadvisable or misguided to silence an opinion, even if it were false, but it is "an evil still" which signifies a moral judgment about free discussion.  Mill expresses a faith that this discussion will yield positive results.  He states, "[People are] capable of rectifying [their] mistakes, by discussion and experience.  Not by experience alone.  There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted.  Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument." (Mill 1859, 24)  Mill presents us with a belief in an objective truth that is revealed only by the clash of opinion.  More openness will yield more truth, and the special value of liberalism lies in its tolerance of all opinion.  Myth, however, calls us to act solely on experience and intuition.  Discussion tends to debase mystery and can reflect a lack of faith in its power.

John Locke hints at a similar proposition.  The only way to avoid the violence of the state of nature is to engage in reasoned discussion.  Locke states that those who "renounced the way of peace, which [reason] teaches, and made use of the Force of War" have effectively "revolted" against their own species and become like "Beasts."  (Locke 1690, 383)  Liberalism, via its emphasis on discussion, is the only system that promises relief from such a brutal lifestyle.

It is very interesting to note how the Lockean dichotomy between supporters of peace (who are by definition supporters of the liberal social contract) and the "supporters of force" has been carried into modern times by a writer like Mises.  Mises writes that "everlasting peace can be achieved only by putting the liberal program into effect generally and holding to it constantly." (Mises 1927, 81)  He later elaborates on this by saying, "it is foolish to rely on arms, since one can deploy armed men only if they are prepared to obey" and that "liberalism had drawn no other conclusion than that, in the long run, truth and righteousness must triumph because their victory in the realm of ideas cannot be doubted." (Mises 1927, 140)  The victory of liberalism, we are assured, is "certain."

Friedrich Hayek follows the line established by Mill.  Hayek tells us that "freedom of research and belief and the freedom of speech and discussion [...] are significant only in the last stage of the process in which new truths are discovered." (Hayek 1960, 33)  Hayek states that the freedom to do what one wants is instrumental to creating situations to discuss, but in the end we are left with a similar faith in the beneficial results of the entire endeavor of research.

For liberalism, free discussion is its claim to legitimacy.  From this rises the emphasis on legislative organs and transparency in government. (Schmitt 1926, 36)  We are told, "Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of assembly, freedom of discussion, are not only useful and expedient, therefore, but really life-and-death questions for liberalism." (Schmitt 1926, 36)  Liberalism cannot bear to infringe on these issues since its entire claim to legitimacy and truth stem from free discussion.  Even when Weimar Germany was facing radicalism from both the left and the right, there was a reluctance to silence particular parties – even when those parties were direct and open about their intentions to dismantle liberalism. (Schwab)  Liberal thinkers will be forced to address the paradox between individual free discussion and the risk that mythical politics poses to the framework that guarantees it.

<b>What's Right for You is Not Necessarily Right for Me</b>

The second reason why liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics is liberalism’s abstinence from value judgments created a failure to address moral issues.  A framework of individual rights that allows individuals to hold whatever opinions they please necessitates a non-interventionist attitude toward those opinions.

With Mill we have already seen his attitude toward opinion; we simply cannot know who is right in an intellectual dispute, so we should allow all sides to be heard.  Mill argues that nobody is in a position to say for certain what is right and what is false.  Mises, about 100 years later, argues the same.  He states, "Liberalism is derived from the pure sciences of economics and sociology, which make no value judgments within their own spheres and say nothing about what ought to be or about what is good and what is bad, but, on the contrary, only ascertain what is and how it comes to be." (Mises 1927, 61)  Liberalism, claims Mises, "has nothing else in view than the advancement of [people's] outward, material welfare and does not concern itself directly with their inner, spiritual and metaphysical needs." (Mises 1927, xix)  Aristotle tells us that political communities form in the pursuit of a good. (Aristotle, 1127)  This good is more than just a business arrangement or an economic organization, but is a moral and spiritual ideal.  He argues extensively that politics is only politics when some kind of moral good is pursued.  Moral relativism is prevalent in value-free political systems.

People want answers to questions about what is right and wrong.  Ceremonies and rituals give people's lives meaning, which is why John Locke's flippancy over such matters when he says (in relation to Baptism and Holy Communion) "The sprinkling of Water, and the use of Bread and Wine, are both in their own nature and in the ordinary occasions of Life, altogether indifferent." (Locke 1689, 40)  Locke trivializes Baptism by saying "that the washing of an Infant with water is in itself an indifferent thing" (Locke 1689, 40) in order to apparently preserve the sanctity of these practices.  More likely, however, Locke is concerned about keeping the peace.  As we find echoed in his own work, he wants to prevent dissenters from openly fighting other religious believers. (Locke 1689, 10)  The supreme end for him, as he makes clear to the reader, is the prevention of violent conflict.  Yet if history is any indication, people are not concerned about dying.  If anything, they are more willing to march to certain death if it is for an ideal or mystery. (Berlin 1994, xxix)  Mythical politics dares to answer moral questions; it steps into that realm of value judgments and in doing so, it provides an ordering principle that can provide meaning to people’s lives.

The individualism promoted by liberalism leads to social atomization. (Guénon 1946, 88; Arendt 1958, 5)  When not reflected in the individual, groups become atomized and separated as they compete under a framework of identity politics. (Neiman 2009, 83) This means that individuals view themselves as individuals living separate and isolated existences away from a broader social group.  A framework of individual rights combined with an official doctrine stating that the use of these rights is not subject to any moral judgment means that individuals no longer have anything in common with each other.  As Aristotle demonstrated so long ago, this state of isolation makes us vulnerable to tyranny. (Aristotle, 1257-1259)  Tyranny, which is to say a government ruled by the self-interest of the rulers and not according to a common good, is successful only when it sows distrust between citizens, sparks arguments and competitions, and promotes an atmosphere of discord.  It is no wonder, then, that liberalism quickly gives way before a mythical politic; people simply find themselves powerless to resist.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: We are told myth is dead. This itself is a myth - and a very dangerous one at that.

In the vein of the Enlightenment, people today are convinced that the expansion of reason and science will do away with old superstitions.  Religion, myth, and anything not falsifiable is on the way out.  We would do well to echo the words of Carl Schmitt: "No one should want to disturb such a beautiful myth and it is, in fact, impossible to destroy it." (Schmitt 1970, 31)  We have shown that liberalism cannot survive a conflict with mythical politics.  A hands-off approach to the nature of discourse that takes place in a society risks fostering the growth of radicalism.  Liberal policy makers have, as a result, found themselves in a predicament.  They can either continue to uphold their beliefs and risk a destruction of liberalism itself, or they can violate the prohibition on intolerance and silence the radical opposition.  Many Western countries prohibit publications that claim that the Holocaust never happened, Russia has proscribed the Communist Party, and defenders of these preservationist policies find themselves unable to present a consistent defense of their actions.  A violation of the principle of free discussion in one realm can easily be used as a justification for its violation in another, but liberal policy makers only haphazardly determine when and where censorship should be applied.

Liberal thinkers will have to more fully address the problems free speech poses; a reliance on Mill's "harm principle" (that one can say what one wants, but one cannot physically hurt another person) cannot adequately answer the challenge posed by systems that seek to turn democracy against itself.  They will have to determine what exceptions there are to free speech.  These same thinkers also need to address ethical issues.  Susan Neiman has already begun a move to return to Kantian ethics. (Neiman 2009)  Her efforts attempt to take skepticism into account while keeping in mind the suffering of innocents as a criterion for moral action.  She attempts to refute my claim that liberalism does not face the ethical questions by forcing her liberalism to do so.  Yet Neiman fails in two regards.

First, she misunderstands revelation.  Neiman claims that the Enlightenment liberals were able to retain reverence to a higher deity while advocating principles of equality. (Neiman 2009, 226-253) The God of the Deists was better than the God of traditional Christians, she claims, because the traditional God was cruel in the Bible.  The Deist God takes what is common to all religions and advocates that, which allows believers to approach the true nature of God as a loving, caring entity.  She states that the Enlightenment Deists were correct to claim that this would reduce religious conflict. (Neiman 2009, 230)  Perhaps Deism would reduce religious conflict, though it may be impossible to ever know since not all of us are Deists, meaning that there are other groups who retain allegiance to an exclusive point of view.  "The God of the Bible doesn't deserve to be God; He is too brutal, too vain, and too petty to meet our real notions of the divine." (Neiman 2009, 231)
Adherents to sacred texts will not care about such a view.  To them it does not matter if God appears a certain way to the outsiders.  What makes sacred texts compelling is their claim to absolute truth, not their propensity to create peaceable relations.  The believer does not care about the "tortured bits of logic" that are required to prove the validity of certain doctrines.  The doctrines are valid because the divine gave humanity the book; humanity's failure to comprehend key features of that book should not be blamed on the divine.  The "I AM THAT I AM" of Exodus will always answer the prayers of the faithful to "rest yet for a little season" since God has a plan outside of the scope of human comprehension; faith means accepting that this will work out for your benefit. (Exod. 3:14, Rev. 7:10-11)

Second, Neiman tacitly agrees that myth will trump rationalism.  She claims that Enlightenment liberals are "committed to the idea that the world can be changed" and that "This idea isn't something they know to be true, any more than their critics know that it's false.  You may regard it as a matter of faith – as long as you acknowledge how many other ideas are matters of faith as well." (Neiman 2009, 137)  This is exactly the point; Neiman has abandoned certain assumptions that used to be based on reason to the realm of myth.  When talking to other liberals, she will rely on reasoned, rational argument; when faced with transcendent views that make claims to forces outside of reason, Susan Neiman is forced to counter with a response also grounded in myth.  She is not alone.

Murray Rothbard attempted the creation of a social ethic from the science of economics several years before Neiman's career. (Rothbard 1962)  His project took theories about human economic action and drew out a system of moral behavior that departed from the value-free approach of previous liberal thinkers.  Daniel Maguire utilizes a mixture of feminism, Malthusian economics, and Unitarianism to create an ethic for evaluating social behavior. (Maguire 2000)  What does all of this symbolize?  People have begun responding to the weaknesses of the current order.  We must also respond and find attractive and believable alternatives.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The first cracks begin to appear in the Eurozone; financially distraught Iceland considers adopting a new currency.

<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21549967">The Economist</a> reports that Iceland is debating whether to move away from the krona and adopt a different currency. Canadians are likely to be thrilled by the idea, since the current proposal is to use the Canadian dollar (known as the Loonie). The move bolsters the Conservative government's claim that the Canadian economy is one of the strongest in the world.

Alan Bones, Canada's ambassador to Iceland said on March 2nd that his government was open to discussing the idea, yet thus far there has been a lack of real consideration for the move. Some politicians in Iceland suggest that the move was a ploy to get Iceland to discuss alternatives to joining the European Union and, thus, adopting the Euro as its currency. The Canadian government was also pretty quick to back away from Bones' initial suggestion.

Current polls show that 70% of Icelanders are in favor of moving away from the krona but that they were evenly split over whether the Euro or the Loonie should be adopted. Since both countries share a geopolitical interest and Canada has thus far avoided some of the default woes that Europe has been facing, it will be interesting to see what Iceland chooses to do. I feel that the debate shows a real desire for alternatives to the Euro; ploy or not, the idea is gaining some traction and might be worth investing energy into. Economists who have analyzed the situation say that there are very few technical obstacles to adopting a currency such as the Loonie since it is well know.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: It's happened - despite all the hand-wringing, apologizing, and bailing out, the Greece default has happened.

Late Friday, a group of dealers in credit default swaps decided that Greece's recent bond swap constituted a "credit event". The yes vote by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association entitles holders of Greek credit default swaps to approximately $3.2 billion. A credit default swap is an insurance policy that can be taken out if a bond issuer defaults.

The Greece default was preceded by a bond swap deal that forced bond holders to take significant losses on the return of their money. The swap, approved by roughly 84% of bond holders, triggered the Collective Action Clause which forced the ISDA to decide that Greece has created a "credit event." The ISDA defines three types of events: bankruptcy, failure to pay, and a restructuring according to Gavan Nolan a credit analyst at Markit. The Greek restructuring is tantamount to a default since the Greek government has basically acknowledged that it can't pay bond holders the money they're entitled to.

Nolan downplayed the event, saying that $3.2 billion was much smaller than expected and that the event is likely to be over-exaggerated.

We have yet to witness a wide-scale default such as this. Far from being exaggerated, the Greece default and the triggering of credit default swaps signifies the beginning of the end for Greece, the Euro, and any myth of stability we've seen thus far in the international financial markets. We're all about to be screwed.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Eric Holder and Chris Christie Don&#039;t Care About Spying on Muslims</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Reports that the New York Police Department crossed into New Jersey to carry out surveillance on terror suspects have renewed the debate over how best to react to the threat of international terrorist groups. Supporters of the NYPD say that the measures were completely justified, while people in New Jersey and the Obama administration have suggested that the police shouldn't be spying on people just because of their faith. Platitudes won't work in convincing people that the New Jersey and federal government actually care about spying on Muslims.

US Attorney General Eric Holder made a few brief remarks on the subject. He said that he was <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/holder-disturbed-by-reports-1377102.html">disturbed</a> by what he read in the newspapers regarding efforts made by the NYPD. Over the past decade, New York City has developed a crack team of investigators to foil terrorist threats. They hired a former CIA spy to head its intelligence division, have posted detectives all over the world, and are rumored to have more Arabic speakers than the FBI.

The Associated Press recently released a report that showed that New York police officers had been monitoring Muslims in New Jersey - and have been doing so for no other reason than the fact that they practice Islam.

Eric Holder and Governor Chris Christie responded that the reports were disturbing. Not only were New Jersey officials not notified of the activity, but critics contend that the government shouldn't be spying on people just because they follow a specific faith. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/05/third-jihad-narrator-plans-rally-to-support-nypd/">Certain Muslim groups</a> have added fuel to the fire by demonstrating in favor of the police's efforts to stop terrorism.

The issue for Eric Holder and Chris Christie isn't about Muslims. Holder made it clear that he heard about the incident from the papers, which reported on the 60-page "demographics" report compiled by the NYPD - covering information on Muslims in New York and New Jersey and detailing how undercover police interacted with them. Holder apparently reads the news, which means that the AP story wasn't entirely new to him: <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1659443,00.html">in 2007, Time Magazine reported</a> that the NYPD issued a report that said that new converts to Islam were more likely to commit acts of terrorism.

The issue for Eric Holder is not that the New York police were targeting Muslims but that Eric Holder's bureaucracy wasn't involved. When the American government unilaterally decides to kill citizens abroad without a jury trial, <a href="http://bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20120306eric_holder_asserts_us_authority_to_kill_citizens_deemed_terrorists">Eric Holder is perfectly ok with that</a>. When the United States <a href="http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=130745&amp;d=6&amp;m=1&amp;y=2010&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom">decided</a> that travelers coming from certain Muslim countries should undergo extra security screenings, not a word of protest from the Attorney General. No, the issue is that the NYPD compiled the 60-page document and that the FBI didn't. Christie's sincerity is also a little doubtful; when he was the US Attorney for New Jersey, the defendents' religion in the Fort Dix case was <a href="http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/national/BO51509/">the main thrust of the prosecution's arguments</a>, much to the ire of Muslim attorneys who said that in a post 9/11 world, such a heavy emphasis on religion can cause people to target innocent Muslims. Christie is siding with the administration on this issue because New York police - without even so much as calling New Jersey officials - were spying on Muslims.

If they would have at least made the phone call, targeting people based on their religion might not be so bad.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There’s been much talk over the last several years about a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. The consensus is, if Palestine were to break off from Israel and form a separate state, then the Palestinians could determine their destiny and the Israelis theirs. Sudan proves the consensus wrong.

Last year, <a href="http://sadredearth.com/the-state-solution-yes-for-south-sudan-no-for-israel/">according to Matt Gregory writing at Technorati</a>, a “historic happening occurred” that caused everyone to celebrate the flourishing and growth of democracy, etc., etc., etc.

The historic happening was the formation of a new state in Africa: South Sudan. Following a horrific conflict, groups in southern Sudan broke away from the Khartoum government and established their own independent country.

According to the traditional, progressive interpretation of the world, such a move would foster peace. If the groups in South Sudan were able to determine their own course, they would do so. If the groups in Sudan proper could determine their future without interference from others, there would be an end to the conflict.

Everyone was happy, including the genocidal dictator. Things couldn’t be better, except that <a href="http://sadredearth.com/the-state-solution-yes-for-south-sudan-no-for-israel/">some pointed out that a two-state solution should be adopted with the Israel-Palestine conflict too</a>.

Today, less than a year later, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17712848">things don’t look so cheerful</a>. South Sudan and North Sudan are crossing into each other’s territories and fighting. From what it looks like, both sides are suggesting the other is at fault. No doubt an example of the flourishing beauty of democracy and so forth.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>John Edwards Faces 30 Years</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: John Edwards faces 30 years for allegedly using campaign funds to cover up his affair with his mistress. Technically he didn't break the law.

John Edwards probably isn't a very decent person. There are probably several types of sociopathic disorders that describe a person who cheats on their wife while she's dying from cancer. John Edwards is accused by federal prosecutors of using up to $1 million in campaign funds which were contributed from wealthy donors to hide his pregnant mistress.

The Edwards trial has been heating up as the jury was forced to listen to the dramatic tale of Elizabeth Edwards' reaction to the affair in which she confronted her husband in the parking lot of an airport, collapsed in a heap, and tore open her shirt and bra. The overall impact of this was devestating to the daughter, Cate Edwards, who left the courtroom in tears and was no doubt an attempt to make John Edwards look evil.

But being evil and breaking the law are two separate things in a country where laws are often divorced from morality. What John Edwards did was clearly attrocious (I would contend that making the trial about his affair instead of about the cover up is also attrocious), but it doesn't seem to be technically illegal. Campaign finance laws dictate that a candidate may only use money donated to him to benefit and promote their political campaign. Prosecutors are saying that Edwards violated the law by using the money to cover up a person indiscretion.

Realistically, if the truth about his pregnant girlfriend came to light, it would have had an adverse effect on his campaign. I would contend that using campaign funds to conceal a scandal that would knock Edwards out of the race for president is a perfectly legal use of the money. To not spend the money would be to irreversibly damage his chances for the presidency.

Cheating on your wife isn't illegal in the United States; in fact, it's a hallmark of the American political culture. Lying about it, even with money, is an ordinary event, certainly not deserving of 30 years in prison.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>More Migrate to Singapore</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: More and more people have begun to migrate to Singapore as the island country begins to appear more desirable than alternatives.

&nbsp;
<h2>About Face for Facebook’s Co-Founder</h2>
&nbsp;

Facebook’s co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, has just renounced US citizenship as he migrates to Singapore for an “indefinite period of time.” According to an IRS list, Saverin renounced his citizenship last September.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-co-founder-saverin-gives-up-u-s--citizenship-before-ipo.html">This article from Yahoo</a> notes that Singapore doesn’t have a capital gains tax and Saverin is not required to report certain foreign earned income. His stock options from Facebook are estimated to be worth several billion dollars.

&nbsp;

Severin doesn’t escape unscathed, however; he will still face an exit tax from the United States on his stock options. Yet because he is exiting prior to the IPO, the valuation of his options will probably be much lower than they are going to worth when he sells them.

&nbsp;

The Yahoo article notes that 1,780 Americans renounced their citizenship, up significantly from the 235 who did so in 2008.

&nbsp;
<h2>Healthy Environment for Medical Research</h2>
&nbsp;

The Singaporean government has worked to capitalize on the willingness that educated Westerners have for emigration. Over the past few years, <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/05/14/singapore-medical-industrys-decision-good-for-medical-tourism-here/">the city-state has been actively promoting the establishment of a medical research hub</a>.

&nbsp;

To date, Singapore has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Dr. Jerip Susil, the Assistant Minister of Public Health, says that the government has been very active in creating a friendly space for medical innovation, international conferences, and medical tourism. New open medical centers have been constructed to make room for the growing number of people who find it less expensive and more beneficial to their health to migrate to Singapore and other countries for medical care.

&nbsp;

Dr. Jerip says that the innovation that comes from the medical industry will positively impact other markets as well.

&nbsp;

Many well-known hospitals and doctors in the region have begun working with and in Singapore to deliver quality healthcare and new technologies.

&nbsp;
<h2>Singapore is the World</h2>
&nbsp;

New York City is often touted as the capital of the world, especially in terms of finance and creativity. Now, Singapore is being branded as the world of creativity.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120514-0000008/The-best-place-in-the-world-to-be-creative">Fredrick Haren</a> moved to Singapore from China and says that the city is a city in the world, not a city in a country in the world. Whatever sort of new age progressive hocus pocus is at work here is beside the point; Haren makes some interesting points about Singapore’s creative environment.

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>The country provides a better quality of life. Haren reports that it’s far easier to live a healthy lifestyle in Singapore because the tools and nutrition are close by.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Singapore is open to new ideas. People tend to be more receptive to new approaches, though one article suggests that they’re somewhat risk-averse.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Other ideas are more accessible. It’s very easy to find people with different perspectives.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>The Singaporean Miracle</h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/singapore-miracle-at-the-center-of-the-world/257082/">Singapore is listed as one of the richest countries in the world</a>, despite being one of the smallest. The country exports more high tech products such as those relating to aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, and the like.

&nbsp;

After starting out as hardly anything more than a swamp in 1819, Singapore has grown into a spectacular example of what decent government and a business-friendly regulatory environment can do for a country.

&nbsp;

With over 90% of the population being property owners and the crime rate being phenomenally low, Singapore remains a bright spot in an otherwise dark world - and a constant lure for people with the means to move there.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Mexico&#039;s Terrifying Triangle of Death</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There are reports of more mass killings in Mexico. As anarchy prevails and drug cartels are free to do as they please, innocent people continue to be brutally slaughtered.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>The Victims of the Triangle of Death</h2>
&nbsp;

Mexican authorities discovered 49 dead bodies on the side of a highway in the Latin American country. This is the third incident of a massacre in the so-called Triangle of Death - the area where highways intersect between Monterrey, Nuevo Leon Reynosa, and Nuevo Laredo. The Triangle of Death has seen some of the worst fighting between two of Mexico’s largest drug cartels are battling for supremacy.

&nbsp;

The 49 victims were found on the side of the road, some in garbage bags. Authorities say that none of the bodies have any signs of gunshot wounds; instead they had their hands, feet, and heads cut off by their killers.

&nbsp;

The 43 men and six women will be difficult to identify, since most methods of forensic identification rely on prints, dental structure, and other key markers that are absent on these bodies.

&nbsp;

This round of killings is the largest of the three incidents. On May 9th, 18 dismembered bodies were found near the city of Guadalajara. That prior Saturday, 23 bodies were found decapitated or hanging from a bridge near Nuevo Laredo’s city hall building.

&nbsp;

Investigators say that the recent 49 were not killed at the scene but dumped their later.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Innovations in Online Education</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Innovation and education are two topics that usually inspire fear and dread in the far right, yet these developments show some signs of positive change.

Peter Klein <a href="http://bastiat.mises.org/2012/05/innovation-in-higher-education/">at the Mises blog</a> discusses some new innovations in online education that are taking place. In particular, Klein points out how organizations like the University of Phoenix have empowered people to advance and how models such as the Mises Academy have challenged the traditional university structure.

Some other organizations have also dedicated significant resources to bringing quality instructional courses online at either a low or free price. For instance, <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> has been set up to provide free computer science courses to anyone who wants to learn programming. Udacity’s founders say that anyone and everyone should have access to advanced programming courses if they have the desire to learn.

Modern tools are often distrusted by people like me. The far right tends to view such things as inherently biased or dangerous because most of the time they’re employed toward evil ends. I would contend, however, that technology in and of itself is fundamentally neutral. Like a hammer, a vehicle, or anything else, the internet can be used for good or for ill.

While I suspect that many of the innovations in online education are going to be used for progressive ends - since almost everything is used for progressive ends because almost everyone is a progressive these days - I feel that the platforms and tools that are being developed can be used to empower contrarians to create their own innovations in online education. What I mean is, the far right can adapt to this new space and create structures that will educate others.

Do you see the potential for a far-right Udacity to provide free or low-cost education in the spirit of reactionary ideas?]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Sometimes I wish other countries’ politics were this exciting. Also, sometimes I wish reality didn’t mirror <i>The Onion</i>.

Árni Johnsen, an MP for Iceland’s Independence Party, <a href="http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/Icelandic_MP_Moves_Elves%E2%80%99_Boulder_to_His_Home_0_390052.news.aspx">has made arrangements</a> to relocate a giant boulder to his home Höfðaból in the Westman Islands. Johnsen believes that the boulder is home to three families of elves, which he first encountered in 2010.

While driving an SUV through Sandskeið on Hellisheiði in southwest Iceland, Johnsen had a fairly serious car accident and his vehicle landed near the giant boulder some 40 meters from the highway. The boulder would reportedly be damaged or moved during a highway project, so Johnsen decided to arrange for it to be moved near his home after consulting with an elf expert.

The expert was stunned by the boulder, saying that she had never seen three families live in one dwelling like this. Johnsen and the expert concluded that the elves would be happy with the move so long as the “window side” of the boulder had a decent view.

Johnsen also plans to move the elves in a basket made of sheepskin while their stony home is transported by ferry. He intends to place the stone near a grassy area since the elves intend to raise sheep once they get settled in.

All in all, Johnsen is quite lucky. This group of elves apparently prevented serious accident,<a href="http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=379383"> while other groups</a> in Iceland have taken to sectarian violence when humans come too close to their homes.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Modernity brought us privacy whereas life in more traditional times was simpler and more open. However, we have become accustomed to the anonymity that social atomization has brought and losing it to a modern system of surveillance is painful.

The federal government has made overtures to allow the Air Force to dispatch unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) to local law enforcement. The goal of the new project would be to help police locate kidnap victims, fugitive criminals, and the like.

Federal officials say that the drone operators could take and keep photographs of people doing things that the government feels may be "of interest." It would seem that my lonely nights of sitting naked in a beanbag chair watching reruns of All In The Family are coming to a quick close. Local and federal law enforcement may soon have the ability to spy on people eating junk food, smoking in front of their children, or participating in our consumerist society a la beanbag chair.

Andrew Napolitano opines on the developments <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2012/05/17/is-there-a-drone-in-your-backyard">at Reason Magazine</a> where he makes two primary points.

First, he argues that it's unnatural for the government to violate our right to privacy. The right to privacy is apparently a natural right, but also a constitutional right (<a href="http://restorus.org/articles/philosophy/natural-rights-divine-rights-or-human-rights">I've explored some of the paradoxes involved in the attribution of rights briefly elsewhere</a>). Regardless of my own views about where rights come from and what those rights actually are, I have yet to see Napolitano or anyone else explain how and in what sense natural rights are natural. This is perhaps especially true with privacy; in pre-modern societies everyone was "up in everybody's business" to speak in the parlance of our time. When you did something wrong, a jury of your literal peers judged you for it. Historically the government could be up in your business whenever they wanted to.

Second, he suggests that this is all illegal. We have to smile at the irony; Napolitano is saying that the government needs to give itself a warrant per the government's rules for warrant-granting before the government will allow the government to spy on you. Should you find that the government didn't follow the government's rules, you may sue the government in the government's courts and allow the government's judges to determine if the government was in the wrong. For rights being so natural and laws being so supreme, <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/jurisprudence/article-five-united-states-constitution">they sure are easy to undo with a little creativity</a>.

What the state giveth so they taketh, including privacy it would seem. Crying out that your rights are somehow natural just because you wish they were is nothing more than the pitiful bleat of weak-willed people neutered by the cold and unforgiving machine of the state.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Extortion Used to Impoverish George Zimmerman</title>

Zimmerman was taken back into custody after a discrepency arose about how much money he actually had.

Zimmerman claimed to be a man of little means, say prosecutors, and they filed a motion to revoke his bond after it was discovered that the Zimmerman family had raised close to $150,000 on a website for his legal defense. In such a publicized case, it should come as no surprise that a large number of people were willing to donate money to a man they didn't know who's accused of murdering a boy they didn't know. Yet the prosecution, who along with the media, seems intent on convicting George Zimmerman for centuries of racial violence, have professed ignorance that publicity could have such effects.

They claim that the large sum of money proves that Zimmerman is a flight risk and, as such, should be held before his trial. The issue is not that George Zimmerman was a potential flight risk, it's that he was a potentially dangerous adversary in court. Normal people don't have a lot of money and can't afford an adequate legal defense. Slightly upper-middle class people can afford the defense for a while, but <a href="http://www2.greene-news.com/news/gcn-news/2011/mar/09/blagojevich-says-cant-afford-retrial-wants-be-sent-ar-893473/">they usually run out of funds</a> to do battle with a government that can simply run up more debt to prosecute criminals.

People like Zimmerman are frightening because the government failed to adequately impoverish him before his trial. Now that he's proven he can raise money on his own, even after the government tried to bleed him dry with bond, the prosecution has to resort to a new measure to deprive Zimmerman of adequate legal counsel. Since the courts in the United States are so backlogged, it will likely be quite a while before Zimmerman has a trial. In the mean time, the imprisoned Zimmerman is unable to work, unable to pay bills, and unable to contribute any further money to his defense.

The question we must ask is, does George Zimmerman deserve to be able to raise an appropriate legal defense? I would argue that he does.]]></content:encoded>

Governments and doctors are advised to help people make sure their partners aren't dealing from the bottom of the deck.

<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2012/gonorrhoea_20120606/en/index.html">WHO reports</a> that drug-resistant strains of the sexually transmitted disease are appearing in Australia, France, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. A strain of gonorrhea appeared in Japan in 2008 which was immune to all recommended antibiotics and has been quickly spreading ever since. Unless the disease is caught and treated early, patients may quickly run out of medical options.

Gonorrhea is the most common STD after chlamydia, spreading to more than 106 million people each year around the world. In 2010, the CDC states that 309,341 cases of gonorrhea were reported in the United States, roughly half of the actual number of infected people. Without adequate precautions, there could be no option for people infected with the super disease. WHO is calling for expanded research into new antimicrobial agents in hopes of finding a drug to treat the strain.

Gonorrhea has already adapted to penicillin, tetracyclines, and quinolones. Health officials warn that the spread of low-potency over the counter antibiotics in Asia and the incredible adaptability of the disease mean that the STD is becoming more and more dangerous.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The European Union continues in its path toward eventual dissolution. Eurozone leaders were divided and confused at yet another Brussels summit on the economy.

<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21555916">The Economist points to two solutions for the European Union</a>. On one hand, Europe could strengthen its ties and erode more of the sovereignty of individual member-states while distributing wealth to poorer parts of the union. On the other, the EU could separate.
<strong>Superstate is Super Stupid</strong>

Individual interests are far too diverse in the European Union. I have been predicting for months that the Euro and, almost by extension, the EU won't last through 2012. The financial crisis that the Eurozone faces is far bigger than any one or even a group of individuals. It's simply beyond their capability to deal with. One may rightly suggest that the leaders are in many respects too stupid to adequately respond. But even if they were geniuses, I would argue that the complexities and different currents driving the crisis are too big for any governmental body to handle.

The EU made a critical mistake in making their union about economics instead of about a shared European identity. Granted, the idea of “Europe” as a singular, yet diverse whole, has been a driving force behind much of the popular support for the union, it isn't the primary focus. It seems instead that the broader policy goals have always been about free trade between member-states, a shared currency, a unified monetary policy, and a foreign policy designed to protect members while carefully vetting new members so as to preserve the favored status of larger parties.

Economic unions work well when the economy is booming. During a period of decline, the selfish ties that brought everyone together tend to drive them apart in new ways.

There has been increasing pressure on Germany to do more to promote jobs and economic growth, but the Germans are strongly against any inflationary measures. No one has adequately been able to deal with Greece's collapse. Very few can suggest any plausible course of action to stop Italy, Spain, and Portugal from following their Mediterranean neighbor's lead toward bankruptcy.
<strong>Independence Day</strong>

Any plan to strengthen the EU is simply a plan to hold every member-state hostage to the crisis. Germany has the sanest plan; manage the deficit as best as possible, avoid inflation, let things correct as best as possible.

To force Germany, thus far a huge industrial powerhouse in Europe, to shoulder the burden of trying to bail every irresponsible European country out of the crisis will only condemn the Germans to a similar default.

Chancellor Angela Merkel is right to oppose mutualization in any form. The only way Europe stands a chance of surviving is if they abandon the idea of the EU. Merkel is the most level-headed leader of any large European power, but she may be powerless to stop the crisis from running to its worst possible outcome – after all, it is much larger than she is.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>What Do the Developments in Egypt&#039;s Democracy Mean?</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Egypt made waves in the international press again this week as a panel of judges declared parliament to be illegal. This has left many feeling dismayed and concerned that Egypt won't be able to fully transition to a functioning liberal democracy. The truth is, it never was able to.

&nbsp;

The Egyptian court's decision was twofold. First, it effectively dissolved both houses of the country's parliament. Second, it claimed that former loyalists to Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's ousted president, may run for office in the upcoming election. The election is scheduled to continue this weekend despite the ruling.

&nbsp;

Mohamed ElBaradei, an Egyptial legal scholar and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, says that the court's decision to dissolve parliament left Egypt in a complete mess. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came out in typical imperial garb and said that there would be "no retreat" from democracy in Egypt. ElBaradei and other prominent figures have decided to boycott the upcoming presidential election.

&nbsp;
<h3>Schizophrenia Ensues</h3>
&nbsp;

The real mess in Egypt is not from the courts, it's from the belief that liberal democracy can function anywhere, much less a country that has no real liberal past. The court decision reflects the paradox present in liberal democracy; both decisions made by the courts are contradictory and confusing.

&nbsp;

The first decision is fundamentally democratic, but anti-liberal. The courts did not decide that presidents were not legal, just the parliament. By dissolving the parliament and allowing the presidential election to continue, they have in effect set up a pure popular democracy in the country. The people as a whole, not the party structure, will determine the future leader. Then the relationship will be one between the leader and the body-politic of the people, with a majority of the people supporting the leader. The decision, in short, is the most democratic one the court could have made.

&nbsp;

The second decision is liberal, but anti-democratic. It's clear from the strength and force behind the uprising that Mubarak loyalists are in the minority. If they weren't, it's likely they'd still be in charge. Allowing them to run is a liberal decision because it falls under the umbrella of the "free competition of ideas and speech" that is the lifeblood and metaphysical necessity of modern liberalism. The resulting cries of outrage are from a majority who feel that Mubarak loyalists shouldn't be allowed to hold power because they are part of an old, unpopular regime. Theirs is a democratic outrage because the old regime was pretty oligarchical and the uprising is predicated on rejecting that oligarchy.

&nbsp;
<h3>A Choice Must Be Made</h3>
&nbsp;

The conflict cannot be resolved. In western countries, people are so used to and inundated with this schizophrenia that they have lost the will to fight for one side or the other. Political conflicts in those societies are short term in nature and subject to incredible bouts of amnesia - when the majority disagrees with a group, that group sides with liberalism; when the majority agrees with a group, that group sides with democracy. The two ideas of majority rule and individual rights are forever in contradiction to each other and are impossible to resolve.

&nbsp;

Egypt does not have the amnesia and apathy common to western societies. When the sides conflict, they angrily demand an answer. They are not yet used to living under a schizophrenic political system.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: China's human-operated Shenshou-9 spacecraft has successfully docked with the country's space lab today. Millions of people in China watched the craft blast off into orbit on Saturday with the Chinese character “fu”, a symbol for good luck and fortune, displayed prominently outside the cockpit.

Other powers in the world have been cutting back their space programs with the worsening economic climate. This launch marks a time where China can stand on par with other countries that have typically dominated the political and scientific scene.

Shenzhou-9 launched at 6:37 P.M. In Beijing time. Aboard the craft was the first Chinese woman to be sent into space – Major Liu Yang from the Henan province. Liu had previously been a pilot in the Chinese air force, successfully landing a plane in an emergency after the craft had collided with a flock of birds after takeoff.

The Chinese government had strict regulations on who could fly on the mission. Chinese astronauts (taikonauts) are required to have good skin, no body odor, pleasant breath, and no dental cavities. A rumor circulating through China says that spaceflight has adverse effects on female fertility, but Major Liu won't have to worry as she's already a mother.

Chinese politicians have widely broadcasted the launch and docking as a sign of the country's growing influence around the world. In addition to their manned space mission, Chinas has been working to develop a blue-water navy and an education system capable of producing engineers to meet or exceed the brain power of those in other countries.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The German chancellor Angela Merkel is one of the few world leaders who isn't being completely idiotic about the financial and economic crisis brewing in Europe. Much to the ire of others, Merkel has resisted political pressure to adopt a more inflationary policy because she feels it would be bad for Europe. <i>The Economist</i> has recently joined her list of critics.

<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21556949">In this week's Charlemagne</a>, the British paper argues that Merkel is misreading history. The hyperinflation under the Weimar Republic left a deep scar on the German psyche; the moral that is preached is that hyperinflation was the result of an insane policy and that economic chaos created political instability and a second world war. A sound monetary policy is key to avoiding a similar outcome.

<i>The Economist</i> argues that hyperinflation didn't lead to Hitler's rise to power, but depression and mass unemployment did. Hitler's Keynesian-like policy of building freeways and rearming Germany solved the problem, so the story goes.

There are two flaws with this argument.

First, it's a little disturbing that such an intelligent paper can, without cringing, point out that Hitler independently came up with a Keynesian theory of economic stimulus and that modern Germany, Europe, and the rest of the world should follow suit because it worked. There's a problem when your policy recommendations follow Hitler's lead. I would also argue that the wanton destruction unleashed by World War II and the Holocaust probably resulted in a net decrease in Germany's economic position when all was said and done. But even if it did work out, I think that <a href="http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/01/27a.php">cheaper pharmaceuticals do not justify using slave test subjects to produce them</a>. I know controlling the cost of health care has always been a concern, but there's more to politics than money.

Second, and in line with the argument that there's more to it than money, I find<a href="http://restorus.org/study/politics/nazi-mysticism"> the claim that economic conditions created fascism is very shallow</a>. The existence of even one martyr proves that humans are not a couple of missed meals away from genocide. The existence of a human history that included economic hardship without a holocaust proves this as well.

Other factors create insane ideologies. I suspect that modern society's shallow insistence that money is at the root of all action probably isn't helping.

On the economic side, Merkel is correct to fight inflation. It's not a choice between inflation and depression; inflation creates depression. Neither inflation nor depression create fascism, though, but that doesn't take away from the fact that inflation and depression are painful.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: With the recent expansion of China's space program, many in the United States are angry that President Barak Obama has cut so much funding from NASA. Being a very contrarian site, Restorus would suggest that Obama's cuts haven't gone far enough: the entire manned space program needs to be shut down today.

Note that I did not say that just the government run space program needs to go, nor did I say that the entire space program has to be shuttered, but I did say that the entire idea of sending people into space is a bad one.
<strong>In Search of Archimedes</strong>

Archimedes wrote that he could move the whole earth with a lever if he just had a place to stand. Manned spaceflight has essentially given human societies access to that Archimedean Point. While not a literal position that we can stand, the inspiration to change the world into our image became a more believable fantasy when we were able to see the planet as an entirety from space.

While the notion of being able to change the world however you want may sound impressive, admirable, and fun, it's not something human beings are capable of and it's certainly not anything we've ever experienced in our condition before.

Humanity is always limited - we only live for so long, everyone we love will die, we require food and sleep, our memory fails, we are faulty. For millennia this has been a fundamental, unchanging fact of human existence. Those who sought to build towers to heaven or be as gods found themselves either cast down or facing the same mortality as everyone else.

Only with the advent of modernity and the belief in the eternal progress of humanity did the idea that we can transform the world, including ourselves, become mainstream.

Many thinkers could afford to be skeptical and still be considered legitimate authorities in their field. They could point to the strange and bizarre fantasies of utopias where we all lived forever and were as smart as Aristotle, and where the oceans were made of lemonade. Pressing the utopian intellectuals on these points was often enough to win the argument in front of the average person.

But now, we seem to have found that Archimedean Point in space. Those who question the idea of being able to totally transform the earth, those who would suggest that humanity will never achieve a fleshly immortality, are no longer legitimate thinkers to the average person. The skeptics and the realists are driven into seclusion and silence. They are always met with the photographic claim, "But we put a man on the moon, we can do anything!"

We must always remember that the material space of this planet has been an immutable part of the human condition. If we somehow reach a point where it isn't, then are we still human?
<strong>Broken Windows Abound</strong>

Most people won't care about spaceflight being a philosophical and cultural death trap. Philosophy hasn't been taught in several hundred years, and most of us sold our souls a long time ago. What those trapped in the narrow paradigm of our age (they call it being open-minded) see is money, and there are plenty of economic arguments against a government run space program.

The advances in science, jobs, and so forth comes at the expense of other expenditures. As Rothbard pointed out, every tax is a tax on production. By taxing the public to fund a space program, the government decreases the production of other things that would have been made or invented had the tax not existed. Also, by then taking that taxed money and using it to buy ceramic tiles, rocket fuel, metal, land, buildings, concrete, and everything else you need to run a space program, the price of those goods goes up pushing other private players out of the market.

For those in the United States who would like their country to stand on par with China, they should advocate for more budget cuts across the board. NASA is just one piece of the bloated government that should go. Maybe then America could be secure in its ability to innovate better than the Chinese.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Amidst fervent denials that it intends to develop weapons-grade uranium, Iran went ahead with its test of the Great Prophet 7 missile. State media reported that the launch of the mid-range Shabab 3 missile was entirely successful.

Western analysts argue that Iran has often overstated its military abilities, saying that the missiles are stil very inaccurate. Nevertheless, the tests came just as a European oil embargo went into effect. Despite Iran's claims that it only wants uranium for energy purposes, the missile test and the continued development of nuclear technology remains a sore spot to Western powers worried about the growing influence of the Persian state.

Israel reaffirmed its committment to use force against Iran to prevent the country from completing a warhead and other countries reaffirmed their angst and displeasure at the Iranian situation. The United States has asked that Israel remain patient as new economic sanctions are put in place. Whether it's possible to starve or bomb knowledge out of Iran is possible remains to be seen.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Bloomberg news reports that retail sales in the United States "unexpectedly" decreased by 0.5% in June. Unexpected by whom?

For the third straight month, the US Commerce Department reported that retail purchases have fallen. The 0.5% decrease in June was greater than the 0.2% decline seen in May. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-16/retail-purchases-in-u-s-unexpectedly-decreased-0-5-in-june.html">Bloomberg News reports</a> that this is an "unexpected" decline since they wrongly forecasted a 0.2% rise in June.

The job market continues to put a strain on US households. Retailers such as Target, Macy's, JC Penney, and others have had a difficult time keeping up with shareholder expectation. Sears has been particularly hit hard by some of the developments in the retail market. In 2012, they have thus far posted a -7.51% profit. While Q2 earnings were a slight positive, the retail giant continues to struggle with its finances as it attempts a number of spin-offs.

"People are just pulling back," noted Michael Carey, the chief economist for North America at Credit Agricole CIB in New York.

The surprise at the report and the misguided forecast are proof positive that mainstream economists exist only to make astrology look like a legitimate field of study.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Political Murder of Bo Xilai</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: It's rare for me to support any (living) politician. A vast majority are corrupt, idiotic, and dishonest. In today's age of modern bureaucracy, it's very difficult for any political figure to make a real difference in a policy sense. China's Bo Xilai was a rare exception.

&nbsp;

In November 2011, <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/bo-xilais-china">I came out in favor of Bo Xila</a>i, who was then the Committee Secretary for the Chingqing Province. Bo had been a popular figure in Chinese politics because he was one of the few members of the Communist Party who was willing to tackle corruption. Bo Xilai spent a good portion of his time as Committee Secretary fighting a campaign against China's organized crime gangs. His fight against the mafia groups in China meant arresting and prosecuting party members who had been colluding with them.

&nbsp;

Bo Xilai's willingness to stand up to his peers in the party and his efforts at restoring confidence in the government's ability to enforce order demonstrated that he was one of the few modern politicians to break existing trends of corruption and decay.

&nbsp;

Bo was set to assume a top level position in China's government, but it would seem that his bravery has made him many enemies.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>The Wife of Caesar</strong>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The story actually begins in November 2011 when Chinese police found the dead body of British businessman Neil Heywood in a hotel room. Investigators concluded that Heywood died from drinking too much and the body was cremated.

&nbsp;

In February 2012, Bo Xilai's former police chief, Wang Lijun, attempted to flee to the US embassy. Wang told the Americans and Chinese officials that Heywood had been murdered and that the killer was Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai. Authorities reopened the case and discovered a link between Heywood and Gu, and the prosecution told the story that Gu killed Heywood after the businessman had allegedly threatened her son. She stood trial for all of one day. According to official media, which has since been repeated as truth by western press outlets, Gu Kailai "confessed" to killing Heywood. She was sentenced to death, but the order for execution was commuted. She is likely to serve a lengthy prison term instead.

&nbsp;

Wang Xumei, a prominent Chinese forensics scientist, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19748018">doubts the official story</a>. The prosecution and Gu's "confession" state that she killed Heywood with cyanide. According to the scientist, cyanide poisoning would have caused asphyxia, spasms, and a heart attack - as well as bright red skin. This would have been easy for officials to spot, especially when a simple test for cyanide poisoning is a common procedure when investigating death from an unknown cause in China. No cyanide report was given in court and there is no body to be examined. What we have is a "confession" along with an agreement from Gu Kailai's family not to appeal the case because an appeal would mean severely limiting their ability to visit her while in prison.

&nbsp;

Coercion at its finest.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>Those in Glass </strong><b>Houses</b>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What has followed since has been disgusting. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/bo-xilais-top-cop-gets-15-years-is-bo-next/">Wang Lijun</a> was charged and convicted on various counts of corruption. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Bo Xilai was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/world/asia/bo-xilai-expelled-from-chinas-communist-party.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">expelled from the Communist Party</a>, accused of a slew of sex and corruption crimes, and will face prosecution.

&nbsp;

The press has uniformly condemned Bo Xilai. Time mockingly reports on Bo's son defending his father against allegations of corruption with the headline "Daddy Dearest". The Christian Science Monitor <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0820/Gu-Kailai-Bo-Xilai-s-wife-gets-suspended-death-sentence-for-British-businessman-s-murder-video">reports on Gu Kailai's confession as if it happened</a> and was witnessed by a CSM reporter, and not based on what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gu-kailai-wife-of-bo-xilai-does-not-contest-murder-charge-at-closed-trial-in-china/2012/08/09/24153ebc-e206-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2_story.html">Chinese press tells us that happened</a>. Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/in-china-mistresses-and-corruption-go-hand-in-hand.html">pompously derides</a> corruption in China. What has been witnessed is not a great purging of China's ruling class of a corrupt layer of rising stars, but a political assassination of the first order.

&nbsp;

It is far too odd for there to be no cyanide report, a quickly cremated body, a surprisingly convenient confession, a coerced agreement not to appeal the case, and a swift expulsion for Bo Xilai from the party just a couple months before they're scheduled to select a new leadership group.

&nbsp;

Bo Xilai's family has been destroyed and he will likely serve prison time solely because he was the only politician in China with the courage to stand up to the corrupt elements in the party. The rise and subsequent fall of Bo Xilai is a testament to how putrid modern politics has become.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Reasons to Legalize Marijuana Overlook Danger to Americans</title>
		<link>http://restorus.org/articles/politics/reasons-to-legalize-marijuana-overlook-danger-to-americans</link>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The initiative has already passed in some states like California. Tomorrow, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado will all have a chance to legalize marijuana use. A think tank claims that among the reasons to legalize marijuana, the change will cut into drug cartel profits, but it overlooks the obvious implication for American citizens.

&nbsp;

The arguments and reasons to legalize marijuana are numerous and easy to find: there is a potential for tax revenue, there is a possibility at redirecting prosecutorial resources to serious criminal threats, there are various libertarian reasons that center on the freedom of personal choice, and so on. But quite recently the Mexican Competitiveness Institute (IMCO) has argued that one of the strongest reasons to legalize marijuana has to be the impact that the policy change would have on drug cartels.

&nbsp;

The IMCO went further to say that the three referendums could pose the biggest challenge the Mexican drug cartels in decades, saying that the legalization of the drug for recreational use by the states would severely curb cartel profits. The IMCO feels that if marijuana was not underground, there would be a severe drop in price and the cartels would lose a fortune.

&nbsp;

The IMCO is probably right. In fact, Mexico has already decriminalized drug use in the country, saying that the efforts of law enforcement should be geared toward fighting the producers of traffickers of the drugs. The cartels continue to subsist because of a large underground, illegal drug market in the United States.

&nbsp;

However, the IMCO and other policy advocates almost completely overlook the legal oddity of legalizing marijuana. What is often left out of the discussion of reasons to legalize marijuana, or is at least relegated to an afterthought, is that marijuana use remains illegal in the United States. Regardless of what individual states decide to do, the federal government still prohibits possession, production, transportation, or sale of the drug.

&nbsp;

When states like California decide to legalize the drug and provide medical cards for those permitted to use it, or when these three states decide that people can use marijuana for whatever purpose they want, they are giving citizens a false sense of security.

&nbsp;

Possession of the drug is a misdemeanor in the United States and is punishable by up to one year in jail. Should the defendent possess a "large amount" of the substance, such as more than one kilogram, prosecutors can decide that the marijuana was being held for a sale. Drug sales are a felony offense and there can often be very strong penalties in federal court. Possession of such a quantity carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. If you live close to a school zone or in another designated "drug-free" zone, the penalties can double. If you possess a firearm, even if it was not used or its possession is not related to your possession of marijuana, you will receive a higher prison term and will be classified as a violent offender, meaning that you are generally held in higher security facilities alongside hardened career criminals.

&nbsp;

But rest assured, the federal government has said that they won't crackdown on medical marijuana dispensaries. <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/09/feds-target-71-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-in-la-county.html">Right</a>.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Authority and Totalitarianism Not the Same in Putin&#039;s Russia</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Western press continues to have a difficult time making sense of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia's "man of action" defies western understanding with many of his decisions.

The Guardian insultingly calls it "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/28/vladimir-putin-russia-crackdown-protest?newsfeed=true">Soviet-style repression</a>". Vladimir Putin has been cracking down on a number of things that he feels are corrupting Russian society. His government has been less than tolerant of anti-government protests in Moscow. The Russian state prosecuted and convicted members of the feminist band Pussy Riot. Putin's agents kidnapped an anti-Kremlin socialist and brought him back to Russia. The government has cracked down on alcohol consumption.

The truth is, Russian society is flailing. Since the end of the Cold War, the country has been practically held hostage by corrupt strongmen and organized crime. The mafia and various unscrupulous types have taken advantage of the weakened state to further their own ends. Once the iron curtain fell, individual ethnic groups throughout Russia simultaneously made bids for autonomy.

Without Vladimir Putin, Russia would have fallen apart. His opposition, as <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/russian-protests-show-no-signs-going-away">I have previously noted</a>, is strange in the sense that it's made up of old Soviets and nationalists who feel that Putin is betraying differing versions of "old Russia". Putin's intolerance of such outbursts is an indication that he does not want Russia to return to the old Soviet ways, nor does he wish to see Russia embrace a nationalistic path that would further alienate the different ethnic groups who are thus far (reasonably) pacified.

Western outlets such as the Guardian have never lived in a society where the established political order is under serious question. The newspapers live in a world inhabited by good liberals who, despite their differences, all agree that their established order (or disorder) is the only legitimate way of life. They cannot comprehend a world where demonstrations are made to overthrow the existing system and replace it with something radically different - in Russia, there are people who long for a state that exalts ethnic Russians over other groups, and there are people who eagerly wait for a worldwide workers revolution to transform the means of production.

Putin's intolerance of these radical elements shows that he recognizes that there are people who do not believe in the legitimacy of the existing order. Putin's Russia is a world where people have realized that political pluralism is in fact deadly to any serious political system.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Angela Merkel is Bluffing</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Angela Merkel's panel of economic advisors have criticized the German Chancellor's efforts at expanding the European Commission's control over member-state budgets. Calling it politically improbable, the group claims that Merkel's efforts have no hope of realization. Perhaps that's the point.

<a href="http://restorus.org/articles/economics/euro-will-end-both-bang-and-whimper">I mentioned this in June</a>: the European Union has two choices going forward. Either the EU tightens its grip on member-states or it dissolves. In the current crisis, there is no middle ground.

Individual interests are too varied for consolidation. The financial crisis is simply too large for any of the Eurozone leaders to sort through, much less understand. Each member-state has an immediate interest in saving itself from the crisis, and these efforts usually involve relying on a larger, more stable country to bail them out. As the bad debt changes hands, the risks compound and everyone is damaged.

Up to this point, much of the bailing out has been done by Germany, the country most conscious of the moral hazard involved with bailouts. Germany has also been under pressure by several outside forces to do more to promote jobs and economic growth - in other words, adopt an inflationary policy, which they have been firmly opposed to.

And now <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/merkel-euro-budget-veto-policy-is-wrong-council-of-advisers-say.html">Angela Merkel's incredible proposition</a>: allow the European Commission to veto individual member-state budgets when they get out of line. Several countries immediately turned their nose at the idea; bailouts are fine, but the whole point of a bailout is to avoid accountability. If an alliance comprised of Germany and other influential European countries could enter at any time and impose austerity measures, that would be, in the words of Merkel's advisors, politically improbable. In a word, it would be a disaster. Individual politicians would be thrown out of office for surrendering their sovereignty to outside powers who would force strict austerity measures on any country seeking a bailout.

Angela Merkel is bluffing. She wants to force the issue now so that the EU either strengthens to the point that she could take draconian measures on irresponsible members, or so that the organization stops pressuring her country into bailing everyone else out. It is, in short, a brilliant move.]]></content:encoded>

Tncountryfan, Flickr.[/caption]

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Several petitions are circulating in various states around America that call for a <a href="http://restorus.org/define/secession">secession</a> from the union. These petitions and the discussions around them are pointless, but not for the reasons you think.

It first came to my attention with an oddly timed <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=bf16b152ccc444bdbbcc229e4&amp;id=7ac4c61f8e&amp;e=c757d9636f">email bulletin</a> from the Mises Institute. Shortly after the American presidential election, the Georgia based think tank emailed an advertisement promoting two books on "resisting tyranny" and working toward secession.

Then I noticed the <a href="http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/opinion/editorials/984116-465/secession-talk-misses-the-point.html">news articles</a>. A rather sizable petition has circulated Texas. Others are going around Louisiana, California, New York, Wisconsin, Virginia, Florida, and more. The petitions were filed on the White House website shortly after the election.

The reaction from the press is typical. The secessionists are "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-cesca/secession-obama-2012_b_2138541.html">whiny babies</a>" who are simply stomping their feet because they're upset about the outcome of the election. <a href="http://theadvocate.com/home/4442502-125/our-views-secession-talk-is">Some writers are indignant</a>; they say that talk of secession is "unpatriotic". Even worse, the discussions put troops in harm's way. It's all a sign of "how sick our political discourse has become".

No, it's not a sign of how sick our political discourse has become. It's a sign of how sick the political structure has become, and how pitiful the political discourse has become.

The political discourse can be roughly defined as the intellectual ideas put forth by different actors. The current "radical" idea is secession - but secession is a joke. There are no new ideas or alternatives being proposed. What discussions exist involve replicating the US Federal Government minus the elements the petitioners don't like. This essentially means replicating the same contradictions, the same crises of character, the same stench of decay. It means replicating the same unoriginality and banality that plagues the current system.

The discussions also signify how ineffective the current structure is. Talk of secession implies that legitimacy is lost. The fact that alternatives are not being discussed shows that no one is creative enough to solve the crisis. If secession is a viable option for people, the existing federal system exists solely through force of arms and not because it commands any real allegiance.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In a traditional display of imperialism and general ignorance about foreign affairs, the UK's Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that his country will recognize the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the "sole legitimate representative" of the Syrian people.

Great Britain's Foreign Secretary made the announcement to the British Parliament, saying that the opposition group was a "credible" alternative to the Syrian government.

Some estimate that 30,000 people have been killed in the 18 month Syrian civil war. Up until recently, the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad's government has been divided amongst itself, but came together in order to topple the regime. Britain asked that the coalition put forward a clear plan for Syria's political future.

In other words, Great Britain has just done two things. First, it got involved in a conflict it has no interest being involved in; the British government went as far as to say that it would intervene if international law allowed it. Second, it backed a group of people who thus far have two aims: revolution and opposition. They have no constructive plans whatsoever - just destruction of the existing regime. The move by Britain was hugely irresponsible as it has sent the message that anything is better than Bashar al-Assad. While his regime certainly can't be classified as good government, it doesn't take too vivid of an imagination to think of worse alternatives.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: In the northern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, eight bodies showing signs of torture were found dead on the side of a road.

Close to 50,000 people have been killed across Mexico in similar violent outbursts since December 2006.<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/25/world/americas/mexico-bodies/"> State authorities report</a> that the eight people found in Chihuahua were likely killed where they were found. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission also reports that 5,300 people have disappeared since 2006 and that 9,000 bodies have not been identified.

Mexican President Felipe Calderon is exiting office this week, to be replaced by Enrique Pena Nieto who was elected in July. Calderon is not one to pass up important issues, even close to his departure from office, for he has called on the Mexican government to address the critical issue of the <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/11/23/outgoing-president-wants-to-change-mexico-name/">country's name</a> - saying that the official name of the country was too dependent on foreign influence, Calderon would like to see a more indigenous name adopted.]]></content:encoded>

The carrier Liaoning is the only such vessel in the Chinese navy. China purchased a Soviet aircraft carrier (the Varyag) from Ukraine 13 years ago and spent about a decade remodeling and reworking the vessel to be included in the modern Chinese fleet.

Of special interest is the new Chinese fighter jet, the J-15, which military analysts are comparing to the American F-18 and the Russian SU-33.

The tests are significant. They come at the peak of maritime tensions between China and its neighbors over several groups of islands. It also marks China's graduation into great power status. Until the commissioning of the Liaoning, China was the only permanent member of the United Nations Security Council not to have an aircraft carrier in its arsenal. China has been working to build a navy with which it can project its power abroad for years. An aircraft carrier, even just this one, is a significant symbol of its ability to exert influence abroad.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Catalonia No Closer to Autonomy</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Self-determination can be a tricky thing. In liberal Europe, this is no less true.

Separatists in the Spanish region of Catalonia have won the regional elections but failed to win in such a way that demonstrated a firm desire to separate from Spain. Voters decided to give almost 70% of the local parliament to four different separatist parties who all advocate for a final separation from Spain. But they didn't favor the main separatist group, Mas's Convergence and Union Alliance (CiU) when they cut their seats back to 50 from 62 in the 135-five seat parliament.

Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, the head of Madrid's office of the European Council on Foreign Relations claims that "Mas clearly made a mistake. He promoted a separatist agenda and the people have told him they want other people to carry out his agenda."

Spain is currently suffering from a 25% unemployment rate and a brutal recession. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is likely relieved by the outcome. Catalan separatist groups have been edging the country toward a constitutional crisis. Catalonian residents believe that a concentration of political and economic efforts in the region could help them recover better than a continued focus on Spain or even Europe.

Mas has thus far attempted to take advantage of separatist sentiments in the country but the recent election demonstrates a faltering support for his particular brand of autonomy. Instead, the Left has made significant gains as a result of the election, to the expense of the center right.

The cracks that run through the European Union are quite deep. Far more than just individual member-states seeking to reassert their autonomy, sub-cultures within the union are attempting to work for independence.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Egyptian Democracy Surprisingly Autocratic</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The surprise, of course, belongs solely to Western press. Students of the old science of politics are simply vindicated by recent developments in Egypt.

Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi shocked many at home and abroad when he seized new powers. Violent protests were launched that reminded commentators of last year's revolution. Mursi issued a decree last Thursday which shielded any of his decisions from judicial review and prompted accusations that he was assuming dictatorial powers.

Over 500 people have been injures in clashes between police and protesters. Some fear that Mursi's Islamic Brotherhood is attempting to assert full powers over Egypt since they won the democratic elections this year.

Egyptian courts have expressed some reservations, but instead of outright condemning Mursi's recent power grab they have simply hinted at a compromise while calling people back to government work for business as usual. The judges say that the judges and prosecutors who went on strike after the declaration should come back to work and that they did not outright reject Mursi's declaration.

None of this is horribly surprising. Democracy, in its purest form, is about the power of a majority over any number of minorities. The fact that the Islamic Brotherhood is taking advantage of its majority status is a sign that Egypt has embraced and understood democracy completely.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Meaning of Easter: Bible Verses and Historical Research to Find Answers</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: With Easter fast approaching, more and more people are revisiting the holiday to understand its meaning and relationship to the Christian faith. But the only way to understand the true meaning of Easter is to examine both the Bible and history.
<h3>The Real Meaning of Easter</h3>
A search for the real meaning of Easter will usually yield articles and commentary reminding Christians that the holiday is supposed to represent the resurrection of Jesus Christ and does not have to do with chickens and bunnies. These elements, it is argued, are secondary to honoring Christ's victory over the cross.

The thesis of this article argues the contrary: the real meaning of Easter has everything to do with eggs, bunnies, and chickens. The holiday that actually marks Christ's resurrection is generally forgotten and, what's more, usually doesn't even fall on the same day as Easter. The first portion of this article examines the pagan roots of Easter traditions. We examine the name of the holiday itself, the Easter bunny, and the history of Easter eggs. In the second part of the article, we look at Bible verses about Easter and how Christians today not only usually ignore the resurrection of Christ but also celebrate a holiday that God has forbidden in the Bible.
<h3>Easter Traditions</h3>
Easter traditions are quite varied depending on what part of the world you live in and what (if any) church you attend.

In the Christian tradition, the 40 days prior to Easter are called Lent. Believers are supposed to engage in a period of fasting, repentance, and prayer. The week immediately preceding Easter is known as Holy Week with Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday commemorating the Last Supper. Good Friday marks the day which, according to the Christian Easter traditions, Jesus was crucified. Easter Sunday is supposed to be the day Christ resurrected and Easter is followed by a 50 day period called the Easter Season or Eastertide which ends with Petecost Sunday which is the date that Christ was said to have returned to heaven.

Setting aside the issue of days, which we shall return to later, the name of the holiday itself is problematic. The word "Easter" comes to us from the Old English Easterdaeg, which itself descends from the Proto-Germanic term Austron. Austron was a goddess of fertility and the spring, and her name is formed from a root meaning "to shine", especially at dawn. The pagan feast of Easter was celebrated at roughly the Spring Equinox to honor and hope for fertility and growth in the coming year.
<h4>Easter Bunny Origins</h4>
The symbol of the rabbit became associated with the traditional Easter holiday around the middle of the 19th century, yet the associations and relationship to the fertility festival existed for many years. In ancient times, the rabbit was considered a hermaphrodite. It was said that the rabbit could reproduce without losing its virginity so the early church quickly connected it to the Virgin Mary.

Rabbits are ancient symbols of fertility since they give birth to large litters in the first few days of spring. As such, the easter bunny's origins lay with the Spring Equinox celebration in honor of the fertility goddess.
<h4>History of Easter Eggs</h4>
Eggs are an obvious and old symbol of fertility which pre-date the Christian Easter traditions. The practice of dying eggshells has been around for thousands of years and was first put into service by Christians in Mesopotamia when they dyed the eggs red to represent the blood Christ shed on the cross.

Many Christian churches have formally adopted eggs into their Easter traditions. They say that the egg is shaped like a stone and is symbolic of the empty grave. The egg is also said to symbolize new life with the resurrection. Yet outside of Christianity it has seen wide use as a direct symbol for fertility. Ancient Zoroastrians painted eggs for a celebration which fell on the Spring Equinox.

Christian churches have made parallels between Christ's resurrection and the eggs, making the history of Easter eggs intertwined with that of the traditional acknowledgement of the Christian event. But they have no direct connection to the event Christians are supposed to be celebrating and instead are related to a pagan fertility celebration.
<h3>Easter Bible Verses</h3>
There is but one verse in the Bible where the word "Easter" is used. This is in Acts 12:4 where it reads "And when he had apprehended him [Peter], he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. In verse 3 we are told that this occurred within "the days of unleavened bread" which is Passover.

In Greek, this word "Easter" is pascha. The Strong's Concordance gives four definitions:

"1) The paschal sacrifice (which was accustomed to be offered for the people's deliverance of old from Egypt)"

"2) the paschal lamb, i.e. the lamb the Israelites were accustomed to slay and eat on the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan (the first month of their year) in memory of the day on which their fathers, preparing to depart from Egypt, were bidden by God to slay and eat a lamb, and to sprinkle their door posts with its blood, that the destroying angel, seeing the blood, might pass over their dwellings; Christ crucified is likened to the slain paschal lamb"

"3) the paschal supper"

"4) the paschal feast, the feast of the Passover, extending from the 14th to the 20th day of the month Nisan"

Elsewhere this is translated as "Passover". What is interesting, and perhaps critical to note, is that 1 Corinthians 5:7 states that we should "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us." Christ became the Passover lamb that was slain to mark our deliverance from bondage.

&nbsp;
<h4>Easter Dates</h4>
Matthew 26:2, Mark 14:1, and John 19:14 all document that Christ was crucified during the Passover holiday. We of course recall the choice the crowd was given to free one of the prisoners for Passover, either Christ or Barabbas.

Passover itself is 14 days after the Spring Equinox. We see in Exodus 12:2 that the first month of the old calendar is Abib, which begins on the Spring Equinox. In Deuteronomy 16:1 it states that the "in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night." We see also in Number 9:4-5 that the children of Israel were commanded to keep the Passover on the 14th day of the first month, which is 14 days after the Spring Equinox.

In 2013, the Spring Equinox was on March 20. 14 days later, on April 3 marks the beginning of the Christian Passover.

So what we have is a celebration of a pagan fertility holiday on a date other than the actual date of the Christian Passover.

What is more uncomfortable for us is the fact that Passover is a High Sabbath day, which makes it holier than the normal Sabbath. Christ became the Sabbath for the faithful (Hebrews 4:8, Colossians 2:16-17) and so his resurrection marks a High Sabbath in Christianity.

The servants of God are commanded to "keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant" (Isaiah 56:6). And those who do not honor the sabbath (Jeremiah 17:27) are destroyed.]]></content:encoded>

The BBC survey was conducted on about 5,000 Pakistanis who were between the ages of 18 and 29. Almost all of them responded by saying that Pakistan was moving in the wrong direction, signalling a vast pessimism present in the young people of that country.

The poll was conducted since about 30% of registered voters in Pakistan are under the age of 30 and the BBC expects them to have a significant impact on the election which is slated to be held in May. Respondents said that the most trusted institution in the country was the military and that Sharia law and military rule were both more favorable than democracy.

In May, we might see Pakistan vote against voting.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: There is much undue controversy regarding Jesus' bloodline.

Fictional works such as <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> make the claim that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children, thus perpetuating Jesus' bloodline to present times. Atheistic criticisms also argue that there is a discrepancy between the two lists of Jesus' ancestors, which means that the Biblical account is contradictory and likely false.

As to the first, it is hardly worth dignifying the claim with a response. All that is appropriate to point out is that Jesus Christ was the supernatural incarnation of God on earth and God had already taken the nation of Israel as His bride. To marry and procreate with another would call into question the arguments that the Lord makes against Israel, saying that they were and will be impatient and not wait for their true husband (thus leading to the great falling away).

The second argument is worth more attention since it addresses Jesus' bloodline as it is actually mentioned in the Bible. In Luke and Matthew there are two different genealogies listed.

In Matthew, Jesus descends from Adam and from Adam's descendant  David, through his son Nathan. This is the natural and legal bloodline of Jesus Christ through birth.

In Luke 3:23, the verse reads "And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli," and it follows with Jesus' bloodline all the way back to Adam through David's son Solomon. This phrase "as was supposed" is key to understanding this genealogy  In Greek it translates to "according to Law". Since Joseph married Mary, Jesus was legally Joseph's son but not actually (as Mary had a virgin birth).

Jesus is legally recognized as being the rightful inheritor of the royal line through Solomon as well as physically being of the line of the priesthood through Nathan. Jesus Christ is simultaneously the High Priest and the King, as the two are united in one person.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Margaret Thatcher, the only female Prime Minister to have held office in Great Britain, passed away earlier this week. To mark the solemn event, more than 700 members of Britain's armed forces will play a role in the ceremonies.

David Cameron, the current head of the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister confirmed that Margaret Thatcher's funeral will honor her role as a war-time leader. Thatcher, who is famously credited with helping to end the Cold War, also successfully defended the Falkland Islands against Argentina's forces.

Margaret Thatcher's funeral will begin with the coffin being taken by hearse to St. Clement Danes in the Strand. There the coffin will be carried on a gun carriage by six horses, accompanied by a sergeant, and officer, and three dismounted foot troops. Members of the Honorable Artillery Company are set to fire processional rounds from the Tower of London.

When her body finally reaches St. Paul's Cathedral, it will be greeted by several members of the serving armed forces. The steps of that great church will be lined by 18 members, divided into three groups of six to represent the Royal Air Force, the Blues and Royals, and the Royal Navy. Also represented at the site will be the Chelsea Pensioners, the Royal Marines, the First Batallion Welsh Guards, and the F Company Scots Guards.

Margaret Thatcher's funeral will mark a solemn remembrance of the Iron Lady who was famous for doing battle with labor unions and communists alike.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Chalking Justin Bieber&#039;s Anne Frank Comment to Age is Insulting</title>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: We don't usually follow pop news on this site, but this particular event seemed over the top.

While on tour in Germany, Justin Bieber left a somewhat controversial comment in the guest book of the museum. He wrote, "Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber." For those not in the know, a belieber is someone who is a fan of Justin Bieber. There was the expected outrage.

Many wrote on the museum's Facebook page comments in disgust. Various words have been used to describe the comment - they range from insulting, insensitive, selfish, shocking, vile, and some have called Bieber a "shallow doofus."

The museum itself is just happy to have someone famous come by and give it publicity so they are certainly not saying anything bad.

The outrage has been followed up by some questions about if people were being too hard on Bieber for his comments. Anne Frank was, in many respects, an average teenage girl and might have been a fan of the pop star's.

<a href="https://twitter.com/simonpegg/statuses/323498077975625728">@simonpegg even wrote on Twitte</a>r that Bieber's comments can be attributed to age. He's 19 and 19 year olds say stupid things.

I find that to be slightly insulting.

First off, age is not an excuse for a lack of intelligence. Plenty of 19 year olds say intelligent things, just as plenty of 70 year olds say unintelligent things. To say that, at 19, you are probably not smart enough to know that you shouldn't make selfish remarks at a museum honoring someone who died in a death camp flies in the face of the way our laws are structured today and the way human society has functioned for thousands of years.

People are often married, raising children, and running a family at 19. Others are fighting and dying in wars at 19. Still more are drinking and gambling (in some places) at 19. To say that at 19, when Justin Bieber has had a large hand in creating his massive and lucrative entertainment brand, Bieber can just be excused for making ridiculous remarks is a bit of a cop out.

Do I think we should censure Bieber and never allow him to live down the remark? No. Do I think this is proof of Justin Bieber's lack of intelligence and sense about how the world functions? Yes, but I thought he was a "shallow doofus" before he visited the Anne Frank house.]]></content:encoded>

Far from shocked at such acts, we merely reflect at how persistent and heinous the forces of chaos truly are. It is tragic that this should strike at all, much less at an event where people celebrate  the conquest of ourselves in the pursuit of a an external noble goal. 

No firm word on who is responsible yet. Personally I sense an individual at work; a group would have owned it by now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: Following Hugo Chavez's unfruitful struggle against cancer, his appears to be the faction firmly in charge of Venezuela.

Elections were held. Elections are always held. After a "close vote", Nicolas Maduro, a friend of the late Chavez, was declared the president. Violence erupted as protestors clashed with police. Before papers could even be filed, the pro-government court ruled out the possibility of a recount.

Violence has been fierce. Maduro has accused his rivals, including the main challenger, Henrique Capriles, of being fascists. Capriles and the opposition party continue to call for a recount of the close election.

61 were injured and eight were killed. Capriles, currently the governor of the Miranda state, has called for nights of cacerolazos. This tactic, which consists of banging pots and pans at night, was used against Chile's Augusto Pinochet and several other Latin American leaders.

The socialist party still hold the reins of power in the country, and it's unlikely this situation will change.]]></content:encoded>

SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The American House of Representatives silently and quickly voted in favor of a new bill called the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA).

Last year, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA), two copyright enforcement bills, inspired thousands of sites to participate in an online blackout. The goal was to demonstrate what the internet might look like if the bills had been passed. Under the existing legal infrastructure, copyright can be enforced by the government if a website fails to comply with a copyright claim requesting that offending material be removed. These claims, which are filed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, are said to be ineffective by intellectual property advocates.

SOPA and PIPA had been successfully defeated after the blackouts, but there is now a new threat on the horizon.

CISPA would remove several legal barriers between the government and companies who have access to personal data about their users. Companies would be able to willingly share information with the federal government.

Unlike the protests against the piracy bills, major tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been silent. Facebook just recently pulled their support.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SODOM &amp; GOMORRAH: The problem with drones is that they impersonalize killing.

Attorney General Eric Holder announced that four American citizens have been killed in drone strikes since 2009. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, Holder mentioned that the United States used a drone to specifically target and kill Anwar al-Awlaki in 2001. Al-Awlaki, Holder states, was an al Qaeda cleric living in Yemen and plotting attacks against the US.

Holder states that the individual in question was displaying a mindset indicative of a desire to kill Americans but that he also actively assisted in helping those who were engaged in plots to kill Americans. Anwar al-Awlaki is, to date, the only US citizen that the Administration has admitted to targetting in a drone strike.

The Justice Department further states that in situations like these, drone strikes should only be carried out under the appropriate constitutional framework and against threats that are imminent yet whose capture is not feasible.

We of course have some issue with this. First, if the threat is "imminent" then it seems likely that capture would not be deemed "not feasible". Being in contact with and sympathizing with people actually carrying out attacks, while living outside the zone of conflict, might make someone a threat but does not make them an "imminent" one.

Second, the constitutional framework calls for a trial, not a "thorough review by Justice Department attorneys". Whether such a trial would be fair or not is a different question, but the Justice Department doesn't even appear to be caring enough to pretend to be fair.

Thirs, the use of drones signals an increasing impersonalization of the killing and death involved in conflict. Flying a drone is, in many ways, like running a flight simulator or video game. You just have to push a button and the person on the screen dies. We are stripping the meaning and reality from the conflict and instructing soldiers, attorneys, and the citizens of the countries involved in conflict to be insensitive to these realities.

Mass killings, extra-judicial strikes, rumored death panels - these things do not come to be through the evil bent of one or two minds. These things happen only once you convince the vast machinery of the bureaucracy that what is taking place is just routine. As Mr. Holder has already stated, this is just in line with what the courts have supported since the 1940's. Nothing unusual here, nothing out of the ordinary, just business as usual.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mr. Finley,
Thank you for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">the informative article on Neoreactionaries</a>. This is indeed a rising political trend and something that would be of interest, even just to observe, by TechCrunch's readers. Unfortunately, I take some issue with the article, but these issues are not with you specifically.

In particular, I am a bit bothered by calling Mr. Yarvin and others "Neoreactionaries". As someone who considers themselves somewhat a reactionary character, I cannot stand the idea of being associated with the ideology that Yarvin and supporters proclaim.

Yarvin has done great work by exposing the flaws of progressivism and encouraging readers to return to the old classics like Carlyle and Evola. But Yarvin and the other "neoreactionaries" do not fall in line with the ideas proposed by these classics.

First, the "neoreactionaries" believe that technology and capitalism have improved us, as you point out. This is not in line with reactionary thought, and something that <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/road-serfdom">I discuss here</a>. According to the old reactionaries - Carlyle, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt">Schmitt</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donoso_Cort%C3%A9s">Cortes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Gu%C3%A9non">Guenon</a> - the modern emphasis on technology and capitalism is part of the problem. They believe that any movement away from a spiritual understanding of the human condition is one that leads to the current problems of democracy and progressivism. Part of the reactionary critique of the twin evils of democracy and capitalism is that our material interests have been made the supreme decider of things. Our politics, our spiritual life, our actions are all evaluated under a materialistic framework. As Cortes would say, if you ask capitalist questions you will find socialist answers; capitalism and socialism are, under the reactionary's paradigm, two sides of the same materialistic coin.

Technology is not held in much higher regard. Guenon believed that technological advances were a sign of a decaying civilization; humanity has used up its spiritual and intellectual capabilities and has now turned to burning out its material state of being. Guenon argued that technological advances merely look like advances just as a fire only looks bright as long as it has some kind of substance to burn. Once we burn out this last vestige of creativity, we're basically screwed.

The loyalty to technology is just the same as a loyalty to democracy; both are religiously believed to solve the challenges of the human condition and do away with political struggle once and for all. See in particular Yarvin's post on the <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/11/dire-problem-and-virtual-option.html">Dire Problem</a> and his idea of <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1.html">computerized guns</a>. It is all an attempt to end politics, and with it the most important questions humans have ever asked. Under the reactionary view, we cannot solve violence any further than we can solve mortality. People fight because they have deep, primal views about the universe that exist in a world grounded in faith, and conflicting faiths will always conflict. An attempt to stop the conflict is an attempt to stop the faith, which is just a repetition of progressivism's promise to end fighting by exposing all to the light of reason and democracy.

Second, the "neoreactionaries" have come up with biological, scientific explanations of the differences between people. See in particular your links referencing the genetic differences between races and the God-awful <a href="http://www.bigwowo.com/2011/10/the-perversity-of-human-biodiversity-a-k-a-scientific-racism/">human biodiversity argument</a>. Evola, who largely gets a pretty stern treatment by modern academics, was even opposed to this idea and criticized its existence in Europe during the 1940's. It is horrendously shallow, insulting, and hardly more than a return to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism">19th century skull-measuring</a>. The underlying goal, then as now, is to reduce differences to something scientific so that it can be brought under human control and socially engineered. The reactionary adopts a view that states that there will always be different cultures because different communities understand the universe in different ways. An attempt to bring that kind of thing under human control will lead to an attempt at wiping out the opposing culture altogether. The reactionary will point out that the concentration camp is a modern invention.

Third, the "neoreactionaries" merely opt for a capitalistic, democratic competition of governments as per your reference to the competing city-states. I refer you to <a href="http://restorus.org/articles/politics/against-seasteading-and-competitive-government">this article</a>.

In short, a neoreactionary is to a reactionary what a neoconservative is to a conservative. A neoconservative is a progressive with a gun just as a neoreactionary is a modern liberal with an angrier government.]]></content:encoded>
